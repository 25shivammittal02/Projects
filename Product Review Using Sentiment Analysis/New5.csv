What I don't like is that every time a device is ""upgraded,"" the upgrades are annoying. On this Kindle, the ""home"" page is changed - it lists My Reading List and My Library. So you have to press My Library to choose a new book. Then it's a list of the books. Why couldn't they just leave the home page showing the small pictures of the books you bought? I have no idea what My Reading List is - it lists books I've never heard of, by authors and topics of which I have no interest. Still, I would recommend a Kindle to anyone who reads books. The screen is easy to read, you can make the fonts bigger or smaller. I don't feel the battery lasts any longer than my old one did, but it's easy to charge. It's thin and lightweight, and I pretty much carry my Kindle wherever I go. Anyone who buys a Kindle will definitely NOT be disappointed!!!",One small thing...

She now takes it to school to read during down time. I took mine on a 2 week trip to the Galapagos. I used on in the airport, on my flights, and several times every day since there was no internet or tv on my ship.

And if your into occult reads like I am be ready to fork out the $$$ for them. The selection does leave some to be desired but not bad. I give the kindle store for books a 3 out of 5.

5,"Amazon Kindle Paperwhite - eBook reader - 4 GB - 6 monochrome Paperwhite - touchscreen - Wi-Fi - black,,,","This is my first kindle purchase, and I couldn't be happier with it. Before I bought it I was very concerned that it would be too small for me to enjoy reading on, but my concern was soon expunged. I have always read books, then as I grew older and my eye sight grew worse, I moved to reading on my iPad Air because I could increase the size of the print. The downside to my iPad though, was that it would get heavy to hold as I read, and after a while I would get some eye strain from the light being projected out from the device, even in night mode to a point, even though that was much better. So I decided to try the Kindle Paperwhite with the new 300 ppi type. I couldn't be happier with it. It's light to hold, even in one hand, which I do a lot, I can still adjust the type size to what I want, the type is very crisp and easy to read, and I find that I don't get the eye strain that I used to. One other benefit to the Kindle is that reading outside is even better than reading inside, which can not be said for the iPad.Another benefit to the Kindle is that if I still feel like reading the book for a while on my iPad, using the free Kindle app, my iPad syncs perfectly with my Kindle, so that it will start on the same page that I stopped on with my Kindle, so that I can seamlessly move from one device to the other.The only slight disappointment that I had with it, was that the battery doesn't last as long as they lead you to believe. I found myself having to recharge it about two thirds the way through the book, but realistically that's no big deal to me.If you are debating on whether or not the Kindle Paperwhite would be right for you to read on, my recommendation is to buy it. I don't think that you will be disappointed.",No regrets with my Kindle Paperwhite.
5,"Amazon Kindle Paperwhite - eBook reader - 4 GB - 6 monochrome Paperwhite - touchscreen - Wi-Fi - black,,,","If, like I, you own an earlier generation Kindle that isn't a Paperwhite, this latest model is WELL WORTH THE UPGRADE.If you don't, it's like having a wider but really no thicker or heavier iPhone 6 Plus to read your Kindle app books (and to use Goodreads) on outdoors. (It even has Airplane Mode.)It had me at its crisp, crisp backlit display and quick response to touch. (I had to really press vs. tap on the older Kindle, and it was so slow to take/load.)",Good for aging eyes and arthritic fingers!

5,"Amazon Kindle Paperwhite - eBook reader - 4 GB - 6 monochrome Paperwhite - touchscreen - Wi-Fi - black,,,","With this 3rd generation of the Kindle Paperwhite, Amazon really created the best reading experience for a reasonable price. I previously owned a first generation Paperwhite, and the increase in resolution (300ppi, up from 212ppi) is really noticeable. After reading on this for a while, it is slightly disturbing to see jagged edges around text of the older Paperwhite. The white balance of the screen has also improved, with a slightly warmer, book-ish experience instead of the cooler, electronic-display-ish screen of the old on. Additionally, the screen can get crazy low in brightness! Ideal for someone who prefers to read in bed at night with the lights turned off.. if you thought the previous Kindles got dark, this takes it to a whole new level of dimness.",The best e-book reading experience
5,"Amazon Kindle Paperwhite - eBook reader - 4 GB - 6 monochrome Paperwhite - touchscreen - Wi-Fi - black,,,","The new version has 300ppi, which is the same as the voyage. There is no reason to pay for extra $80 just for the page press.",best choice in the market

5,"Amazon Kindle Paperwhite - eBook reader - 4 GB - 6 monochrome Paperwhite - touchscreen - Wi-Fi - black,,,","This review comes with a caveat. Many tech sites say e-readers are dying, kind of like the ""Nintendo is doooooomed"" crowd, or the GPS is obsolete argument. I don't disagree. As our phones become more sophisticated and the phone screen sizes continue to balloon up to tablet-like proportions, dedicated devices will continue to go the way of the dodo. But sometimes, if you're interested enough, a dedicated device is precisely what you need. I had (key word: ""had"") an ipad mini 2 that I had been using as my all-round in-bed Netflix + reading machine. Except I'd get about 3 seconds in before getting nudged by my wife due to half the room being lit up. As I spend more time reading on my ipad than watching Netflix, I decided to sell my ipad mini and just buy 2 kindles - one for my wife and myself. The new Kindle Paperwhite feels just as solid as the outgoing model, but the resolution is now 300 dpi. The e-ink screen almost feels like a page of a paperback when you swipe, and in my personal preference, I like that.The battery is rated to last 6-8 weeks on average between the various tech sites, which trumps my ipad mini by several life cycles. Yes the screen has to refresh unlike a tablet, but it's not very noticeable and I don't find it distracting at all for reading.Cases aren't nearly as ubiquitous as for the ipad, so you've basically got the standard Amazon-branded leather case or offbrand cases from sites like Ebay.I enjoy reading, and I frankly don't want to wear any thicker glasses than I already have. Backlight can cause bad eye strain, so that's another plus for the Kindle over the iPad.In summary, TL;DR: if you want a dedicated e-reader, you can't go wrong with the Kindle PW. The price:performance ratio is much better than the Voyage IMHO.But that's assuming that you're somebody who spends enough time reading to make the Kindle device worth carrying. If you only read for a few seconds here and there, adding an extra device to lug around isn't for you. So like a Garmin, the market has a specific niche and YMMV depending on your needs. For me, the Kindle was a great fit.",Excellent e-reader

This is my first Kindle device, so I can't compare it to previous Kindle versions. The only drawback to using the Kindle app on the previoulsy-mentioned devices is that they can't be seen in direct sunlight. And that is the biggest advantage I see to owning a Kindle--you can read outside in daylight. Also, the kindle is very light and portable and easy to use. It does what it says it will do and you can't beat the battery life. The X-ray feature is also a bonus that you don't get with the app.",Great for what it is

The only regret is that, a few days after my made the purchase, there is the $10 saving promotion...",must have for some who likes to read
5,"Amazon Kindle Paperwhite - eBook reader - 4 GB - 6 monochrome Paperwhite - touchscreen - Wi-Fi - black,,,","This is my first ereader. I've wanted one for awhile but wasn't impressed with features until the two most recent versions of Paperwhite were released (I have the latest version). I've read a few books and several magazines on it, so at this point I'm familiar with it. Basic functionality is excellent. For reading text it's pretty straightforward; magazine articles with images worked well for me, but I can see where screen formatting could be an issue for more complex illustrations. The backlight is very good (I wouldn't buy an ereader without it). Pages flips are lightening fast, and the touch screen is mostly quite responsive with minimal pressure (I have a few complaints, see below). Nice integration with the Amazon leather cover, you can just close the book and it shuts down. Buying books from Amazon is simple, and they are delivered via my home WiFi in seconds. Battery life seems endless, and recharge is simple (the included cable charges via a PC, wall charger is an accessory you must purchase). Great device for older readers, as you can kick up the font size and lighting for squint-free reading. It's about the size of a small paperback book and as light as a feather.My complaints: 1) Ads are mildly annoying, it's aggravating to pay more for an ad-free version; 2) Availability of books from my local library remain shockingly limited, even though these devices are hardly new; 3) The Amazon library for book loans (available for a monthly fee) is also very limited. I had a 30-day trial period, during which time I searched for several classic novels on both Amazon and my local library -- big fat zero across the board for my entire reading list. Want to read Catch-22 or Atlas Shrugged? You've got to buy it. ; 4) Highlighting is clumsy using a finger, although I've improved over time. Changing the highlighted area by dragging the electronic tabs is useless; 5) If you like to flip through a book, the Paperwhite will take you to the furthest page touched when you reopen the book. If you've read 50 pages, but went forward to see something on pages 180-190, you'll return to 191 next time. If you flip around a lot you'll get a real mess. Manual bookmarks are the only solution. 6) It's my understanding that when you buy a book from Amazon, you are getting a license to read that book on an Amazon device only (you are not getting a generic ebook that will work forever on any device). So if you buy a different brand of ereader 5 years from now you'll have to rebuy your library.Despite all this, I'm glad I bought it and would recommend it if you'd like a dedicated ereader versus a tablet.","Love it, But Not Perfect"
5,"Amazon Kindle Paperwhite - eBook reader - 4 GB - 6 monochrome Paperwhite - touchscreen - Wi-Fi - black,,,","I bought this as a replacement for my wife's old Kindle 3g. I got the wifi version only since she rarely used the 3g. I have to say that this version is much nicer in some ways and is lacking in others. My wife really misses the physical keyboard, but she has quickly gotten used to the touch-screen. The dpi is MUCH better, and the screen is much easier to read. The refresh times are a lot better. I don't see there being a need to upgrade if yours is currently working, but you shouldn't hesitate if you're in the market for an excellent e-book reader.",Paperwhite is great!

5,"Amazon Kindle Paperwhite - eBook reader - 4 GB - 6 monochrome Paperwhite - touchscreen - Wi-Fi - black,,,","I love reading before going to bed, but backlit electronic devices tend to keep me awake just when I should be getting tired enough to fall asleep. The screen has a great resolution, the device is a snap to set up, and there's little to no glare if you take it outside. Additionally, the battery lasts just about forever. Straight out of the box I used it for almost three weeks before I charged I, and I still had nearly a quarter charge left. It's now my preferred reading device as compared to my tablets, which include an iPad and an LG Gpad. Highly recommended.",Great for reading before bed

5,"Amazon Kindle Paperwhite - eBook reader - 4 GB - 6 monochrome Paperwhite - touchscreen - Wi-Fi - black,,,",I debated for over a year about getting a Kindle. After trying to read my tablet outside this summer with sunglasses and sitting under an umbrella...I finally bought my Kindle Paperwhite. I couldn't be happier and I've read more books in the past couple of months then I have in years. It's as good as they say and easy to read in ANY light!,Couldn't be happier
5,"Amazon Kindle Paperwhite - eBook reader - 4 GB - 6 monochrome Paperwhite - touchscreen - Wi-Fi - black,,,","I upgraded to the Kindle Paperwhite from a 1st generation Nook, I think just about any e-reader would excite me.However, I did my research and decided that the Paperwhite was a perfect fit for me. * I love the speed of the downloads and the ease of the touch screen. * I love being able to keep track of different characters just by pressing on their name (as well as definitions of words that are not familiar) * I love the backlight - no more trying to read at night with a glaring light over my shoulder. *I love the battery life. Not having to recharge it everyday is awesome!* I love how lite it feels and the way it fits in my hand - soooo much better than the Nook... overall smaller in size although the screens are the same size.I am an Amazon Prime member and some of the books that I have downloaded (and ones on my wish list) are half the cost of the same B&N books.I find that I am reading much more and totally enjoying the experience of my Kindle. I wish I hadn't waited so long!!Last but not least, I LOVE buying from Best Buy. I love their protection plans and when needed, they have always saved us $$$.",LOVE it!!!!

5,"Amazon Kindle Paperwhite - eBook reader - 4 GB - 6 monochrome Paperwhite - touchscreen - Wi-Fi - black,,,","I have had several Kindles from the Kindle keyboard, the Fire HDX and a previous version of the Paperwhite. To me, it's the best way to read. You can have hundreds of books at your disposal. Having the 3G version enables me to download books anywhere without being connected to Wi-Fi. I love my Paperwhite!",Love my Paperwhite
5,"Amazon Kindle Paperwhite - eBook reader - 4 GB - 6 monochrome Paperwhite - touchscreen - Wi-Fi - black,,,","I had a kindle Paperwhite that I'd bought in summer 2014, and by summer 2015 something had gone funky- it wasn't charging anymore. So I upgraded to one with a higher PPI a couple months ago. The difference is slight; in fact I haven't noticed it at all. If I went back to my old Kindle I'd probably notice that the quality had changed, but really, it's a very minor upgrade. But that doesn't matter- because the Paperwhite is awesome anyway! I am a woman, and I can fit it in the back pocket of most of my jeans (so dudes definitely can), it slips into small purses and it holds a charge for weeks. I have a pretty big collection of physical books, but I really enjoy having a library on a tablet that I can bring with me too. I buy physical books when I want to linger around a book store, or for poetry, or books that I want to high light or share with people, or that I like the covers of. I buy Kindle books that I really want for the story, or that are on sale on the Kindle store, or classics that are cheap (a couple bucks) or free. The Vocabulary Builder is really nice- I just highlight and lookup words that I want to know more about, then it provides a definition for me and saves the word as a flash card so that I can practice later at my convenience. I use my Kindle at night- the back light is perfect for reading right before bed. I wholeheartedly recommend this device if you just want a reading tablet. I might get another tablet for watching TV or playing games, but I just wanted a dedicated reading one, and this is perfect for me.",Convenient and Awesome

I always have a variety of books, to suite my reading taste. I got a rocketfish wall charger for a great price at bestbuy and it's so much easier to charge my kindle. I've been reading for almost 10 hours on the same charge. If you love books you have to get one of these! My house would be full of books, but now I can get books I would not otherwise purchase because of physical space limitations. I have over 100 books on my kindle and it takes up less space than 1 book. Many sites offer free or reduced price books.

5,"Amazon Kindle Paperwhite - eBook reader - 4 GB - 6 monochrome Paperwhite - touchscreen - Wi-Fi - black,,,",With the newer 300ppi screen the Paperwhite really hits the sweet spot in the Kindle lineup.,The new screen is amazing!
5,"Amazon Kindle Paperwhite - eBook reader - 4 GB - 6 monochrome Paperwhite - touchscreen - Wi-Fi - black,,,","Purchased this as an upgrade to the first generation Kindle Paperwhite. The backlight is greatly improved, the display is of a higher quality, the words are clearer and the internal process is a lot quicker — opening books and page flipping is noticeably speedier.The one thing that does annoy me about the 3rd generation Paperwhite is the way it's manufactured — when you hold it at a certain angle and you look at the bottom of the screen, you can see a small section of the display covered in the e-ink used to render the words and images on the rest of the screen. At first I thought this was a manufacturing defect, so I took it back to Best Buy and exchanged it for the same model, only to find that the second model had the same issue, except more-visible.This appears to have something to do with the way the display is placed behind the bezel during the manufacturing process. When the Paperwhite first came out, it was the crown jewel of Amazon's e-reader line, and Amazon was careful to precision-craft the devices. Now, that honor falls to the more-expensive Voyage, with the Paperwhite becoming the flagship, but still cheaper, option in the Kindle lineup, meaning the manufacturing quality of the Paperwhite is likely a bit reduced compared to that of the Voyage.This won't be a huge annoyance for some people. It is for me. And it's seriously made me consider whether it's worth contacting Amazon over.For everyone else, though, this is a great e-reader and well worth the money. If you're looking for an e-reader, this is the one to buy.","Good, but one small thing annoys me..."

5,"Amazon Kindle Paperwhite - eBook reader - 4 GB - 6 monochrome Paperwhite - touchscreen - Wi-Fi - black,,,","I have bought this kindle for almost one month, and almost use it every night. It's comfortable for your eyes. I like it.",worth buying
5,"Amazon Kindle Paperwhite - eBook reader - 4 GB - 6 monochrome Paperwhite - touchscreen - Wi-Fi - black,,,","I read as many reviews as I could find before buying this newest Paperwhite and what struck me the most was the contrast of the bright screen versus the print. However, when I got mine, I had to put the brightness level to 19 (out of 25) to get it to a comfortable setting. Doing that makes my battery run down before I've even read two books, and that is with the airplane setting on, meaning the WIFI is off. Luckily, I bought a charger so I can charge my Paperwhite while on trips ( without my computer, in a regular outlet) or at night when I'm finished reading. Now for the positives. I love the light weight of this Kindle even with the preferred cover that shuts it into sleep mode when closed. I absolutely LOVE the dictionary feature, because it is so easy to use and it saves the words I don't know, for study. After I've learned a word's meaning, I can delete it from the list. I got the Paperwhite with the ads, because it is nice getting suggestions of books I might enjoy that I might not see otherwise. And books are easy to order from the Kindle Store and to download through this devise. I like the cover, because it protects the screen from scratches while stored in my purse and I also purchased a stylus to keep fingerprints off the screen and I like that. Generally, I am happy with this purchase.",Love it but for one thing

5,"Amazon Kindle Paperwhite - eBook reader - 4 GB - 6 monochrome Paperwhite - touchscreen - Wi-Fi - black,,,","This is the second Kindle I have owned. Paperwhite appealed to me for its reader-friendly settings and backlighting. My first Kindle was a keyboard model with no backlight so I used a ""clip in"" light that fit in my M Edge case. I forsook the keyboard this time as I rarely used Kindle for web browsing. I also abandoned my fear of advertising to select the ""special features?"" model. Ads appear only at start up and are quickly and easily dispatched - there's only one ad so all you do is swipe up and it's gone. The new Kindle has exceeded my expectations. After I get books to put on it, I turn off the WiFi and the device will go for weeks without recharging. (Btw, I purchased an inexpensive Fintie case which shuts down Kindle when you close the cover and sends it to sleep - it's never really totally off.) You just have to remember to put your reading on the device itself rather than in the ""cloud"". The backlighting is awesome and the Paperwhite e-ink and font great for older eyes. My only complaint is that the ""collections"" setup is not particularly user friendly and the icons take getting used to on the toolbar. However, I am totally happy with this purchase and glad I updated to Paperwhite.",Paperwhite Is a Great Device

The book advertising on the lock screen is so cool in my house, its such a small thing but it makes us smile every time. I do think its kinda weird that it flickers sometimes but after watching product videos I see that its not abnormal. Maybe if I looked it up I'd understand but its not bothersome enough to do so. Overall I would buy this item again no questions asked.",I love this thing! It goes with me everywhere.
5,"Amazon Kindle Paperwhite - eBook reader - 4 GB - 6 monochrome Paperwhite - touchscreen - Wi-Fi - black,,,",I had a kindle for several years that I thought was adequate until I purchased the paper white.

So it's good when I am moving around by bus. Book downloads are instant and don't take a long time; something I was concerned about. And the screen is truly comfortable, no strain whatsoever. The functions within the Kindle are also convenient enough to use. I bought it for $99 during Black Friday deals.",Met all my expectations

I now read about 12 books a year (that's a lot for me). I finally upgraded to the Paperwhite for the backlight feature. I take it with me everywhere in case I have an extended wait time somewhere. But I mostly use it in bed. The size makes it easy to hold. It's a lot better then holding a cumbersome book and doesn't hurt as much when I start to doze off and drop it on my face. I have set the text size big enough to read without my glasses, get in bed, turn on the backlight, and read in the dark. Good for reading in sunlight too. I only read books with my Kindle, so I didn't see the need to buy the Fire. And I only needed the Wi-Fi version (no 3G desired). I also didn't see the need to pay $80 more for the Voyage.",Holds everything I read

She loved the Paperwhite and I didn't know what I was missing out on. Don't get me wrong, I love my iPad, it's just that it wasn't designed to be only a reader.

That said, I picked one up on a whim during Black Friday and I finally understand what the fuss is about. The text customization options make it easy to design/find the perfect reading experience, and the fact that I can send Instapaper articles to my Kindle from all my other devices is awesome. The fact that the screen is lit from the edges (as opposed to a backlight) makes it noticeably less draining on the eyes.Only downside is the fact that Amazon makes you spend $20 to get rid of those pesky special offers (which force you to swipe the screen to dismiss them every time the device is turned on).",Great for a newcomer to e-readers

I've read more in the past month than I had in the previous year.I have no complaints about it at all. Small and durable. Light works great and is easily adjustable. I thought I would hate the advertisements but it's really just on the screen when the power is off, then it goes away when you start to read.

5,"Amazon Kindle Paperwhite - eBook reader - 4 GB - 6 monochrome Paperwhite - touchscreen - Wi-Fi - black,,,","I spend a lot of time looking at a computer screen; when it comes time for leisure reading, it is nice to have relief from bright light. The paperwhite Kindle provides a very eye-friendly experience, with sharp text even at a small size. And there's no struggle with holding open pages of a book. Unlike the Kindle Fire, obviously, it is not a good choice for browsing the web or reading e-mail. Navigation between books is not as easy as I would like; a half screen of 6 recent books, with the other half taken up by ""recommended"" books is not as handy as a full-screen text list of my books would be. But the actual process of reading is easy, and there are a few tools for note taking and seeing how frequently other people highlight sections of text. Cross-book text searching is a great feature, if you need it, too.","feels good in the hand, great substitute for book"

5,"Amazon Kindle Paperwhite - eBook reader - 4 GB - 6 monochrome Paperwhite - touchscreen - Wi-Fi - black,,,","I really like this product. It is my first e-reader. My family has had them but now that I have my own I love it. It really looks like you are reading a real page in a book and the backlight is what really makes the difference for me. It allows me to read anywhere even in the dark without worry about fumbling with a reading light. Although I love the feel of a real book and watching the bookmark go further through the pages I am starting to get over that. The connivence of holding this instead of a book and also being able to have multiple books going at once without carrying a bunch of books with you is great. I can fit this in my coat pocket on the train while I commute. It is pretty small and now that I figured out how to borrow kindle books from my library via overdrive I save a ton of money by borrowing instead of paying for all my kindle books. I definitely recommend this Kindle Paperwhite product, the 300 ppi screen is really nice and the price is very reasonable.

5,"Amazon Kindle Paperwhite - eBook reader - 4 GB - 6 monochrome Paperwhite - touchscreen - Wi-Fi - black,,,","I was a previous Voyage owner for a year but then left it on a plane (don't forget to check the seat-back pocket before you leave!). I was debating whether to buy it again but all the reviews I saw online said it wasn't worth the $80 premium - they're right.First off, the resolution is the exact same 300 ppi on both models. The Voyage does have better contrast but it's something I stopped noticing after 24 hours. The backlighting on the Paperwhite also isn't as even, as I notice it's darker on the bottom but again, I stopped caring after a few uses. The weight difference is negligible and they both have incredibly long battery lives.About the only time I miss the Voyage is when it comes to the page turn buttons. On the Paperwhite, I have to touch the screen, so when I'm lying in bed, I'm forced to use two hands to avoid it from falling on my face. With the Voyage, I could just press the page ""button"" and keep my hands on the border. Again, far from a deal breaker and something I adjusted to quickly.Overall, the Voyage is the better Kindle but not worth the premium cost.",Skip the Voyage and buy the Paperwhite

The screen's front-lit display allows me to read under all lighting conditions, from bright sunlight to dark, without eyestrain.I bought the Paperwhite as a supplemental reader for my Samsung tablet so that I could read outside. After several months of use, I'm finding that I do all my reading on the Paperwhite.I read several hours a day and the battery lasts four or five days under that usage, which is a great change from my tablet, which needed a recharge daily, usually at an inconvenient time.I recommend buying the companion leather case because the case puts the Paperwhite to sleep with the cover is closed, extending battery life.","Solid, all-around Kindle reader"

5,"Amazon Kindle Paperwhite - eBook reader - 4 GB - 6 monochrome Paperwhite - touchscreen - Wi-Fi - black,,,","I never thought I'd be an e-reader person, always preferred a paper book. I am dyslexic and decided to try out this Kindle at the recommendation of a friend. I LOVE IT! I've read more books since I bought it last month than I have in years! Reasons it is perfect for dyslexics: You can change the font size, line spacing, margins, and the actual font. The last reason is the best. Recently Amazon added the Open Dyslexic font to the font options and it's fabulous! The next best option I found is Helvetica. Another thing that I like about the Paperwhite is that it has a matte screen, not a LED one like most electronic devices. It eliminates eye strain and the ""blue light"" issues at night. I also love that our library has the ability to borrow e-books, which has helped me save money on the books.",Perfect for Dyslexics!

5,"Amazon Kindle Paperwhite - eBook reader - 4 GB - 6 monochrome Paperwhite - touchscreen - Wi-Fi - black,,,","My previous generation Kindle Paperwhite got scratched a little on the screen, so I debated about picking up a new Kindle, but it was worth the $120. The 7th generation Paperwhite has twice the memory, runs a bit faster so it's noticeably quicker in response--making highlighting and annotating easier, and the uneven screen lighting problem (the older Kindle had ""shadow"" spots on the bottom edge of the screen) has been solved.My only complaint is that Amazon continues to put ads on the Kindle, which you have to pay $20 to get rid of. It's almost necessary because I use the Kindle to view books in church. Very inappropriate when the ad for a murder, crime, or romance novel pops up as a screensaver.",Worth the upgrade

5,"Amazon Kindle Paperwhite - eBook reader - 4 GB - 6 monochrome Paperwhite - touchscreen - Wi-Fi - black,,,","This product has been so thoroughly reviewed that I won't repeat the obvious in any detail. It's great for reading under all conditions -- sharp typefaces and, of course, illuminated. Two small issues: 1. in dim light conditions the light at the bottom of the screen is a bit uneven. There are slightly darker areas just above each of the four lights that illuminate the screen. This does not bother me and it isn't noticeable in a brightly lit environment. More annoying is the fact that the Search function doesn't work with some books: for those, searching brings up no results, no matter what I enter. I have the same books on my Kindle Keyboard and have to use that to find what I'm looking for. I haven't contacted Amazon about this, but it seems odd. On other books, it works as expected. One other thing to keep in mind if you have an older Kindle is that it will need to be recharged more frequently, given that it's illuminated. Overall, I like this reader as the display is excellent, it's easy to hold, and page-turn and other navigation features all work well. If it weren't for the problem with searching, I'd give it five stars.",Meets most expectations

It's lighter than some of my books, which is great, but the best thing is that I can read at night in bed without disturbing my wife.The e-ink display allows you to also read outside in direct sunlight, perfect for the upcoming summer months. It's relaxing to just go out to a local park, sit under a tree, and read your new book.If I had to find a fault with this Kindle, it would be the ads. You're already paying a decent amount for an e-reader, then if you don't want ads on the lock screen, you have to pay Amazon more money. They don't really bother me, so it's not worth taking away a star. They might bug you though, so just keep that in the back of your mind before buying this that you will have to pay Amazon $20 to have them removed.","Great, even for a casual reader"

But it came to the point that my battery was suffering from this. What I love about the Paperwhite is the battery life, about 8 weeks. In addition to that, you can turn down the brightness to the point that it looks like an actual page, so its actually better for your eyes. I have about 300 books on my paperwhite so I am beyond satisfied. Definitely worth the $.",Great buy

5,"Amazon Kindle Paperwhite - eBook reader - 4 GB - 6 monochrome Paperwhite - touchscreen - Wi-Fi - black,,,","This is an excellent choice for an e-reader. I purchased it specifically for a vacation in the sun. It did a great job, was easy to use and overall allowed me to easily read out in the bright sun. the backlit display at night was very nice and makes reading a breeze anytime without problem. I have an older nook book that is color. I chose the amazon version so that I could subscribe to the unlimited monthly reading program. in comparison between the 2 brands I do like the nook better for easy of moving between pages - I haven't figured that out quite yet on the kindle, but I'm sure it's quite easy. there's also no person that I can quickly drop into the store to ask a question on how to do something. if you are a person who likes being shown how to use a device. I know my mom who is 80 might have a little problem with some getting the screen at the top to pull down but 95% of the people most likely won't. Best thing I like and am glad I invested was the backlight.",this is a great paperwhite e-reader.

5,"Amazon Kindle Paperwhite - eBook reader - 4 GB - 6 monochrome Paperwhite - touchscreen - Wi-Fi - black,,,","Comments on Kindle Paperwhite1) Basic functioning of page forward & back - excellent2) Footnote action often led to loosing place. It was easy to accidentally press a footnote when doing normal forward or back. Pressing the top right “x” sometimes returned to text, but often was dead - requiring selecting “Go To Footnotes”. Picking the correct < footnote returned to correct position - but too easy to accidentally press a different footnote - send me off to wrong text position. While doing things right raises no problems - it is to easy to get in trouble. Enabling the “x” at all times would be safer.3) Occasionally a small print message such as “91 highlighters” would appear between the lines.

5,"Amazon Kindle Paperwhite - eBook reader - 4 GB - 6 monochrome Paperwhite - touchscreen - Wi-Fi - black,,,","I love reading!!! I was first using my iPad mini as an ereader. Originally it was purchased to be used strictly as an ereader but I found over time it was causing eye strain. I couldn't read for more that 2 hours without my eyes starting to hurt. After a little research and watching tons of Youtube videos I purchased my Paperwhite. I absolutely enjoy my kindle. It's light weight (my iPad weighs a ton), it's easy to download and access books, you can read on tons of platforms. I have been using an app called ""Overdrive"" to check out ebooks from the library. Now I don't have to get in my card and drive to my local library. I can just browse from my home via my smart phone. If you enjoy reading and your thinking about getting a kindle please do! It's the best purchase I've made in a long time! I was limited when I was using my iPad mini. Now it's like a whole new world has open up since I've started using my kindle. I have read several books by Stephen King since owning my kindle.

Unfortunately, the newer Nook's screen would turn black and practically unreadable in the sunlight. So I got the Kindle. SOO happy! The screen is wonderfully readable, even in bright sunlight, and is capable of being back-lit for night-time reading as well. Best of both worlds ~ Especially since I seem to take reading material with me everywhere I go!",Awesome for outdoor reading!
5,"Amazon Kindle Paperwhite - eBook reader - 4 GB - 6 monochrome Paperwhite - touchscreen - Wi-Fi - black,,,","With the advent of technology, picking up and reading a normal book feels cumbersome.

5,"Amazon Kindle Paperwhite - eBook reader - 4 GB - 6 monochrome Paperwhite - touchscreen - Wi-Fi - black,,,","The Paperwhite is a decent enough product for someone wanting an eInk screen. I don't understand some of the lack of customization options, even on what seems to be simple things. Like why can't I see the TIME in the status bar? Why can't I customize the ""click zones"". Also, contrary to Amazon's claims, my PC app does NOT sync the documents that I emailed to the device (the Android App does, though). I also see their ads when the device is off and starts. If they gave me the ability to save those recommendations (as opposed to ""read now""), I might have checked a couple of them out by now. Still, for the money, it gets the job done and helps keep my eyes from getting as tired as they did when I just used my phone to read.","Good device, but has some minor issues"

5,"Amazon Kindle Paperwhite - eBook reader - 4 GB - 6 monochrome Paperwhite - touchscreen - Wi-Fi - black,,,","After struggling to read books for the last several years, my husband suggested getting an e-reader. I never wanted one, because I previously enjoyed the feel of a real book in my hands. He was pretty convincing, so I went online and researched a few different ones. I settled on this one, after reading so many great reviews. I wanted the Voyage initially, just because it had page turn buttons, but I opted to save some money, and the page turning with the touch screen is incredible, I don't think I'd use the buttons, even if I had them. I am already halfway through my first book, and I've had this less than 24 hours. I'm a very slow reader, so this is impressive! I tried it in the sun, and it was extremely easy to read- no glare. I also used it while working out today- it's very easy to adjust the font to make it easier to read. I am so in love with this, and am so happy we bought it! I am excited to get back into reading, and to have thousands of books at my fingertips!",Great E-Reader!

I really like the ease of this device - purchases download to it directly, and if you have existing files, you can email them directly to the kindle and it will format them accordingly. The definition on the paperwhite is really nice, and the backlight is gentle on your eyes (crucial if you are a late night reader like me). I have the ""special offers"" version, and it is not intrusive at all, just appears on your lock screen. Battery has been great so far.If you are an Amazon Prime member, they even throw you a free ebook each month. And yes, I bought a protective cover for it this time!",Great E-Reader

The Paperwhite is very light weight and it's easy to use. The touch screen is not always as responsive as I'd like it to be when on the home screen or managing your library, but once you've opened a book, it's easy on the eyes and page turning is very responsive. I'm glad I have this option for reading as it's much better than reading on the Fire. If you want a full tablet, get a Fire but it you just want to read, the Paperwhite is great.",Great e-reader

I thought she was spending too much time engaging in mindless activities on her phone and computer and thought this might be a good alternative. She has responded surprisingly well. One feature that I really like is the dictionary. If she comes across a word she doesn't know or can't read, she can tap on it, and the dictionary will pop up defining the word. This enables her to use her inference skills to decode the word or understand the meaning better. This has been a nice addition to her bedtime routine.",Perfect for whole family
5,"Amazon Kindle Paperwhite - eBook reader - 4 GB - 6 monochrome Paperwhite - touchscreen - Wi-Fi - black,,,","I love my new kindle.

I can read on my kindle then audible will pick up where I left off, so I can continue with the read during my commute. My kindle will then propose to move my place to where I left off in audible. It has made my commute very purposeful because I am able to read literature for work a lot more efficiently.

5,"Amazon Kindle Paperwhite - eBook reader - 4 GB - 6 monochrome Paperwhite - touchscreen - Wi-Fi - black,,,","Well, it happened. I became a huge fan of e-books, preferring them over an actual, physical book! This old fashioned woman with a preference for all that is vintage NEVER EVER thought that would happen; then came the Kindle Paperwhite. I think I have read close to 10 books this past month because of the Paperwhite! I can make the font larger (which is great for my old eyes), and it is lit from the side, so it does not make my eyes tired like typical LCD screens, where the light shoots up at your eyes. Because of this, you can read easily in bright sun or in total darkness. Also, the battery lasts a very long time; I usually have to charge it only after reading a full book. And an added bonus is that you can't get any apps on the Paperwhite, which sounds like a negative, but that means there is no distraction/temptation to surf the web instead of read. When you open it up, you are committed to reading. It is sooooo much better than my Nook, which makes my eyes tired and is a distraction.It is among the best purchases I have ever made!",I Love Reading Again!

5,"Amazon Kindle Paperwhite - eBook reader - 4 GB - 6 monochrome Paperwhite - touchscreen - Wi-Fi - black,,,","The Paperwhite is an excellent product. It is very lightweight, easy to hold for long periods of time, and user-friendly (software wise). Be prepared to have a slower reaction time than a typical tablet (or Amazon Fire); this is because of the e-ink. However, I will take the trade off, as you are able to read e-ink in every environment (sunlight, dark rooms) without any eyestrain -- something that is not possible with a regular tablet. Screen response time is only slightly delayed because of this.If you have a Prime membership, you have access to all of Amazon's library, which has a large selection; however, most disappointingly, you can only rent one book per month unless you upgrade to Amazon's Kindle App, which is an additional $10/month. I find this to be mildly frustrating. However, you are able to rent books from your local library whenever you would like.Overall, I think the Paperwhite is a fabulous product for reading, with only a few drawbacks. I enjoy reading on it very much.",Great Product

5,"Amazon Kindle Paperwhite - eBook reader - 4 GB - 6 monochrome Paperwhite - touchscreen - Wi-Fi - black,,,","With my love of turning paper pages in a book and not being a techie, I held off rushing into buying one of the many tablet readers available. I spent quite a bit of time reading reviews and talking to others before making my decision, and I am so glad I did my research. What I like most about the Kindle Paperwhite: the adjustable screen lighting is spot on and easy on my eyes, whether I am reading in dim room light or bright sunshine outside; the ease of syncing it with my computer and wifi; the speed of downloading a book; the ability to adjust the font size; the ability to bookmark and pick up from where I stopped reading; and the size and weight which makes it very portable. I opted for an envelop-style sleeve for storage rather than a cover you might use for an iPad or similar tablet. It's easy to slip the reader out of the sleeve and begin reading. I am thrilled with this device and give it two thumbs up. For me, there is no substitution for the feel of real paper, but this reader comes close.",Great Reader

5,"Amazon Kindle Paperwhite - eBook reader - 4 GB - 6 monochrome Paperwhite - touchscreen - Wi-Fi - black,,,","I am looking at the oasis and voyage but thinking they will be expensive paper weight in 3-4 years because that is the average life of kindle, this is my #4; they get slow, froze and die after 3-4 years. Moving from first gen paperwhite to the newest version, here are the noticeable changes:1. speed- this version is snappy, the new UI takes a little time to get used to.2. the LED lighting is even, no more ghost at the bottom of the page.3. cloud storage, book can be opened from the cloud and just start reading.Just like any other kindle, set up is easy, downloading over 100 titles of book to the device is fast. I do average 12-20 books a year, with the kindle of course, no worries on where to store them. Although the form factor of the oasis and voyage is very tempting but that additional price can buy lots of books!One complaint that I have is the USB cable is too short!",Kindle for book lovers

The lit screen is bigger, and makes it readable in a wide variety of lightnings. The text is crisp and easy to read.

5,"Amazon Kindle Paperwhite - eBook reader - 4 GB - 6 monochrome Paperwhite - touchscreen - Wi-Fi - black,,,","I bought this device because my Fire HDX wasn't adequate for reading in direct sunlight. For sunlight reading, I give the Paperwhite a 5. However... I cannot change the display time before the screen sleeps, the reading location jumps backward and forward a lot when I touch the screen (when I thought I was just going one page either way), the home screen is confusing and not user friendly (only 3 books visible on ""show specials"" model) and the battery only lasts one day if I read 5 or 6 hours. For those reasons, I give it a 3 for both design options and user friendliness. That's a 3.6. Averaged up and gave it 4 stars.","Excellent screen in sun, poor device options"
5,"Amazon Kindle Paperwhite - eBook reader - 4 GB - 6 monochrome Paperwhite - touchscreen - Wi-Fi - black,,,","So happy with this Kindle! It's very easy to use, lightweight so you can carry it in your bag like you would with a paper book, except here you have an entire library with you.It's easy to download books, you can set up a wish list, read several books at the same time and you never loose your page.The screen lights are fantastic when you read in the dark, and there's absolutely no glare when you read in the sun.The only drawback is that I thought I would be able to purchase books on any amazon site so that I could read books in French if they're not available on the U.S. site, and it turns out you can't. You can only purchase the ebooks from the country your Kindle is set up. That was a real disappointment, as I had read some reviews before buying it where they said you could...Overall, I absolutely love it and if you're a book worm like i am, than I would absolutely recommend it. I would actually recommend it to any one.",Love my new Kindle

Product needs to be able to shut OFF! Very unhappy about this. Advertising says will hold charge for weeks - not so, when Kindle paperwhite cannot be shut down. It only holds a charge for a few days, if you read for a couple of hours each day. 2. I have books that I do not intend to read often and want them left in the cloud. I am finding it very close to impossible to return any of my books to the cloud - IT SHOULD BE EASIER!! Amazon made it easy to change Kindle's when I purchased a new one.

So, after my last journey I decided to try a Kindle.Well, I must say I'm not going back to paper! It downloads titles in seconds, holds a mini-library, and fits easily in my purse.

She gets most of her books from our library with Overdrive and has had no problem with downloading them from Amazon. The Kindle is light and holds and feels like a book.

For me, I was trying to choose between the regular Kindle and this one. The major difference there is the back-lighting. Holy cow, I simply cannot get across how much I've used the backlighting. I mean, I can't even imagine at this point NOT getting this one over the regular Kindle. I've even taken to reading before bedtime, in the dark, and then putting the Kindle down when I'm sleepy. Seriously, if you're trying to figure out which one to get, the Paperwhite is definitely the way to go, especially because of the adjustable back-lighting.

Now, I don't actually read often but wanted to buy something to help me read what I do have within my kindle account. I was stuck between getting this and the original kindle. Thankfully, I got this. Mostly because of the textured screen and backlighting. The backlight is what did it for me. I read reviews about the original kindle being hard to read in the dark, and that's when I would be reading the most. If I had seen how hard it really as to read, it would have gone back immediately.The weight is a little heavy for constant reading but nothing to really complain about. The battery life could supposedly last 8 weeks. But, apparently I am a bookworm. I have to charge it every other day with max settings.One thing I am thrilled the most about is the easy of accessing a dictionary or encyclopedia, the notes, and the highlighting. It tells you when others have highlighted other sections of a book I am reading as well.

Also I prefer to have the name of the book listed rather than a picture of the cover of the book. The picture is too small and unclear which makes it difficult to see which book it is and you only get three on the first page. I prefer to see as much as possible at first glance. Also, I love the lighting that is adjustable and allows you to read in bed and does not disturb my night's rest. Overall, I really enjoy using it.",Kindle is good. Best Buy service is poor

I don't believe it was called Paperwhite, but its the one without the keyboard at the bottom. It has been a great Kindle, however, I've always been disappointed that it did not have a back light. Now that I have a back light, I have no idea how I managed before. Even reading before bed with the lamp next to the bed on, the back light makes a big difference. The extra resolution is nice, but not really a huge thing when you're talking about text on the screen. The battery life is definitely reduced when running the back light, however, not to the point where I have to charge every night. I'll still likely get several weeks of battery life before needing to recharge. Overall, if you're looking to upgrade, this is the Kindle to get. The back light is a huge upgrade for me.

I will cover some other general observations,If you send a pdf to your kindle email , it will sync it to your kindle. But the fonts appear small when you open it in kindle paper white and the menu option did not allow me to change font size. You have to convert the pdf to be able to adjust font size.You will be able to convert your existing pdfs by sending a email with ""Convert"" in subject line and including the attachment and sending it to your kindle email (refer to amazon settings for finding out your kindle email). However it may lose the tables or other code diagrams from the original pdf so that is a pain (varies from pdf to pdf). Also if you are used to ios or android, the page turns are not the same like flipping. when you tap or perform a page flip,It will blink for a sec and refresh the page to move to next page. I found this a little annoying but it works. if you buy a book online then that might be a better option as it will let you read the formatted content correctly.Battery usage is fantastic.Another positive is that the inbuilt lights are not glaring in the dark so you will find reading to be a pleasant experience. They have settings to adjust brightness as well.",Good device for reading books you buy.

I just loaded up with some great books and take off on a vacation. I used to load up with actual books and leave them behind as I finished them.

5,"Amazon Kindle Paperwhite - eBook reader - 4 GB - 6 monochrome Paperwhite - touchscreen - Wi-Fi - black,,,","The Paperwhite makes it possible to condense a lot of books in one small device, thereby saving your house from looking like a warehouse. You can pack a lot of books into your suitcase with a Paperwhite. If your device gets stolen, lost or trashed, you may lose a substantial portion (or all) of your personal library. The Paper white allows you to increase size of print Big Advantage. Use of hand gestures to turn page allows faster reading. It's awkward to hold, lying in bed.

5,"Amazon Kindle Paperwhite - eBook reader - 4 GB - 6 monochrome Paperwhite - touchscreen - Wi-Fi - black,,,","I am a hardcore HARDBACK book reader - it's always my preference. I always said I liked the ""feel & size"" of a ""real"" book over any electronic book reader. Boy was I wrong. I bought my Kindle on a whim while it was on sale, and I absolutely love it - I never imagined how much MORE I would read on the Kindle - I have gone through book after book after book, while a hardback still sits waiting on my nightstand to finish. It's a great size - throw it in my purse and read anywhere. The light is nice for darker reading situations. One of the best features in my opinion is borrowing books. You can borrow one book a month free through Amazon's Kindle Lending Library -- but you can borrow as many as your want from your local library (if it participates). That is where most of my reading has come from. I love the Kindle more than I ever imagined and recommend to any reader, especially those, like me, who swore on hardback ""real"" books!",Love my Kindle

5,"Amazon Kindle Paperwhite - eBook reader - 4 GB - 6 monochrome Paperwhite - touchscreen - Wi-Fi - black,,,","I previously had a standard Kindle...the battery would no longer hold the charge. I wanted to replace it but be able to read in dim light. This feature is great. I chose the paperwhite because the screen did not glare like the Fire. It took some getting used to since it is all touch screen, but it has a few better features than the original. One complaint is that it sometime jumps further ahead than one page, so you need to pay attention when moving to the next page. I recommend it for someone who wants to use it for reading only.",Great for leisure reading.

5,"Amazon Kindle Paperwhite - eBook reader - 4 GB - 6 monochrome Paperwhite - touchscreen - Wi-Fi - black,,,","I've had every Kindle e-reader available. Though it doesn't have all the features available on the Voyage, the Paperwhite is the best. The issue I've had are the emergence of tiny light ""leaks"" emerging from the source through the matte textured page background. They're little pinhole-sized, bright light scattered across the page. It usually begins with just one, or two, and becomes several over time. It's distracting to reading. In a conventional book, it would be like having a small speck of dirt on the page. If these little things don't bother you, then it's not an issue. The Paperwhite models don't seem to have this problem as often as the Voyage does. I went through 3 Voyage models before surrendering and returning to the Paperwhite. The Paperwhite has fewer total lights, so it's not as evenly lit as the Voyage, however, it's nothing significant.",Inconsistent quality

I don't see much purpose in the upgrade and I don't know who wants a bigger bezel. The touch works fine. My only complaint is there is no speaker and at this price it should.

5,"Amazon Kindle Paperwhite - eBook reader - 4 GB - 6 monochrome Paperwhite - touchscreen - Wi-Fi - black,,,","Let me set the stage for this review: I joined a book club this year and have started reading a lot... or at least what I would consider to be a lot, which is about 2 decently-long books a month.Up until buying the Paperwhite, I was doing most of my reading on my iPhone using the Kindle app. Long story short, I ended up returning the Paperwhite after about 2 weeks. Why? Because I realized just how sporadic my reading was. I read when I'm out and about, waiting at a doctor's office, or in-line at a restaurant, etc. It became overwhelmingly apparent to me that the best E-Reader is the one you have with you at all times. For me, that's my iPhone.The actual reading experience is definitely better on the Paperwhite. However, if you're an ""on-the-go"" reader like me, then it just means you have to carry around another device. Dedicated E-Readers are for people who either truly read a ton, or have a set routine for reading. If that's not you, then stick with your phone.",You better read a ton

5,"Amazon Kindle Paperwhite - eBook reader - 4 GB - 6 monochrome Paperwhite - touchscreen - Wi-Fi - black,,,","I was using another brand, from another vendor. Problematic. Continuation of reading erratic. When I began to attempt to read where I left off last, unit would take me back to random page or completely start the book over. Went through 2 readers, and both were faulty and very frustrating. The last stopped taking a charge. I read very good reviews of the Kindle. Pitched the other two (and they weren't cheap). The Kindle holds a charge for weeks not days and selection and price are light years ahead of the other service. Recommended to a friend and she loves it.",Easy to use. Outstanding product

After using the Kindle app on various tablets (iPad and Samsung) I finally realized that what I was mostly using the tablets for was the Kindle App.Buying one was a no-brainer and the Paperwhite is excellent. The Bookerly font is exceedingly readable and the backlighting is adjustable so that I don't keep my significant other awake when I'm reading in bed.

For those who do have the time, this is a great device because you can take it anywhere and read it easily in pretty much any lighting situation. The text is crisp and easy to see but I wish the screen was just a little bigger. I ultimately took this back and went with a Kindle Fire HD 8. The pros of a tablet outweighed the cons for my situation, but the Kindle Paperwhite is still a great option for people who read a lot and want to read their books anywhere they go.",Great device for avid readers.

5,"Amazon Kindle Paperwhite - eBook reader - 4 GB - 6 monochrome Paperwhite - touchscreen - Wi-Fi - black,,,","The Amazon Kindle Paperwhite was a gift to my husband. He is very happy with it for several reasons. Reading from the non-reflective screen is effortless, and he can adjust the size of the characters. He can take notes and highlight parts of the text. Two really neat features are: 1. If you take notes on a book that you borrowed from the library, those notes will still be there even after you return the book. So, if you happen to borrow the same book a few weeks later, when you open the book on your e-reader, your notes will be there. 2. In a complicated story with lots of characters, the e-reader keeps track of who is who. In a paper book, you would have to flip the pages back and forth to figure that out. No need to do this with the e-reader.",Very good e-reader

This is a tremendous step up. I usually use my kindles for reading on the beach. I love that it is small and fits in my beachbag or purse. I like the back light on it also. If I had to make one constructive criticism I would have liked the page turning to be more like turning the page on a book like the kindle app on my phone works. Occasionally, if I don't hit the page turn in the right spot I get other ""stuff"" that shows up. Not a huge deal but I would like it to be more intuitive in that regard.",Love this

5,"Amazon Kindle Paperwhite - eBook reader - 4 GB - 6 monochrome Paperwhite - touchscreen - Wi-Fi - black,,,","An 'okay' reader. Reading from an iPad mini is better under all conditions except outside in sunlight. Plus, with the iPad you can play games, web search, etc. The Kindle library function is not nearly as good as the Kindle app on the iPad where you can see many more of your books on a page and scroll through them all quickly versus the slow swipe function of the Kindle. I also do not like the page turn of the Kindle versus Apple. Every page turned on Kindle is like slow motion and about every fifth page refreshes entirely. I actually have to go to the top of the next page slowly in order to not have to wait for the Kindle slow page turn. Even the reading in the outdoors feature of the Kindle is not as great as reviewers indicate as there is still the sun glare on pages that you have to deal with, although at least you can read with it outdoors. The Kindle also suffers from a 'shadow' along the bottom of the screen. The explanation is that it is actually a shadow that is between the lights that are shining upward for night time reading. Draw your own conclusions as to whether that is good engineering. It is worse on some of the devices I saw than on others. Kindle serves the purpose for reading at the beach and not worrying if it accidently gets damaged. I would never take an iPad to the beach, but the Kindle is almost 'disposable' in contrast. Maybe 3 stars is being a bit generous but it is a good supplement to the iPad. If Apple ever makes their device so it can be used outside without a glare, then I don't see any market for the Kindle at that point. Not sorry I have a Kindle, but for what I decided to buy it for (reading at beach) it is at the price point where it is not really worth it. I still read ""paper"" books for those who remember what those are and those still work perfectly for beach reading.",Not as great as reviewers rate it.

5,"Amazon Kindle Paperwhite - eBook reader - 4 GB - 6 monochrome Paperwhite - touchscreen - Wi-Fi - black,,,",It's certainly better than the original kindle. The touchscreen is hard to get used to and it's easy to accidentally forward through several pages or chapters if you fall asleep with your finger on the screen.

5,"Amazon Kindle Paperwhite - eBook reader - 4 GB - 6 monochrome Paperwhite - touchscreen - Wi-Fi - black,,,","I am on my 3rd Kindle. This software downloads new purchases with a picture of the cover of the book on my homepage. Only about a fifth of the available space. So this would only allow you to buy at most four books at a time before the covers would be too small. The new books should be downloaded to my Library in List Form as in the original Kindle. In addition, once you have looked at a book in the homepage, it disappears and you have to search for it or place it in a category. Finally, this system disallows you from manipulating books the way you want. This OS is definitely NOT USER FRIENDLY. It requires a great deal of effort of the user. A lot of wasted data space and waste of time. I am requesting a return to the original Kindle OS.",Original Kindle OS was the best.

The size is small enough to fit in my purse and pull out whenever I have the time. The charge lasts forever, so I'm not always looking to plug in.

I belong to a book club, so it's nice to be able to add notes when I want to and to have the dictionary right there if needed.

5,"Amazon Kindle Paperwhite - eBook reader - 4 GB - 6 monochrome Paperwhite - touchscreen - Wi-Fi - black,,,","This is my first e-reader. The screen has a nice feel to it. It reads really well. I don't like the fact that Amazon has total control of your purchases. I do not like the Amazon free unlimited book trial. They don't allow access to certain titles. So far I am able to find most of my book selections. I will be creating my own reading lists and want zero input from Amazon. The battery life seams to be awesome. Of course when you shut it off ads pop up. The kindle claims that it doesn't take up battery to display these ads. But they seem to mysteriously change on their own (even when it is turned off) Strange. It is super nice that you can read in the dark with this one. (Kindle Paperwhite) I like the fact it is small enough to carry around in a purse, yet big enough to read...the font is adjustable too, if you need bigger letters.",Just ok

The touch screen capability makes it so much handier than turning pages and navigating with buttons, and the lighted display lets me sit and read wherever I like.

I love reading books and the kindle paperwhite really helps. I used to read books on the iPad all the time but it would strain my eyes. After reading all the reviews I decided it was finally time to get a ereader. Since I had my iPad already I just needed one to strictly read books, so I got the paperwhite. It is so nice to read from especially in the sun. It's almost like reading from the actual book. It's the perfect size to read in one hand and stores so many books, even some for my child. It's also great for traveling. I have all my books on hand no matter where I go. There are only two cons to the paperwhite. One is that the touch screen is not that receptive as compared to an iPad. At times it doesn't register my swipes or taps. The other con is that it's only black and white. It really isn't a problem when I'm reading, just for the children's books.",Easy to read

I don't like to change once I get used to something so having to go out and buy a new Kindle was hard but I need my books. The paperwhite is great because the light is built in so I didn't need to hunt down a lighted cover. The reason I went with the paperwhite is because I can't read with my glasses on it gives me a headache and that model you are still able to adjust the font.It works great in sunlight I read on beach for 2 days while on vacation. It transfered all my books from the old kindle as soon as I registered it also so I still have my library.I am glad to say after being skeptical of change it was a great decission.,Paperwhite is great

5,"Amazon Kindle Paperwhite - eBook reader - 4 GB - 6 monochrome Paperwhite - touchscreen - Wi-Fi - black,,,","There is nothing else left on the eink market anyway but the Amazon Kindle. It still doesn't support epub format of course, Amazon doesn't like competition. It is built OK, moderately cheap plastic, but no squeaking at least. Contrast is OK, I had Nook and it is on par. I can't imagine how bad the regular Kindle would be though. This one with 300 dpi is just OK. Scrolling is fast enough, it has integrated vocabulary. No home menu or other physical buttons though, besides the home Kindle one - the UI is not completely responsive when you try to go to your Library, instead home brings you to Amazon Kindle page, where you are overwhelmed with advertisement.My biggest dislike is the volume of advertisement and thus the convoluted interface. It is WAY worse then Nook, which is much more reading-centric.A lot of cheap and free books are available on Amazon, especially with Prime membership. It can be linked to public library for ebooks as well.",Good eink ereader

5,"Amazon Kindle Paperwhite - eBook reader - 4 GB - 6 monochrome Paperwhite - touchscreen - Wi-Fi - black,,,","I broke my Kindle Voyage after almost two years. My heart was as broken as the glass cover!After looking at the latest line of Kindles I decided to try the latest Paperwhite as it had the same screen resolution and was a lot cheaper. Plus, a white model to match my other white/silver gadgets! It does have a few less LEDs for backlighting, no flush glass cover (but that is what broke), no auto-adjusting light (that never quite worked anyway), squeezy sides, and a tiny bit heavier/bigger than the Voyage. The Voyage also has had no hardware updates since it was released and the new crazy-expensive Kindle uses leather and has no not-leather option for people who don't like their high tech wrapped in animal skins. So instead of saving up for a while and reading on my phone, I sprung for the Paperwhite.I've been using this for about a month and the quality has impressed me. I don't miss the glass cover as much as I thought I would, although sometimes pet hair will get caught between the bezel and the screen and need to be pulled out. The screen is great, doesn't clash with the white casing, and although not quite as even a backlight as the Voyage, still much better value for what you get. The software is essentially the same, and Amazon has been slowly improving Kindle software for all the recent models.If you like Amazon for books, I highly recommend this Kindle. You can't beat it for price/value and it really doesn't feel any heavier even after an hour or two curled up with your books.",The latest Paperwhite is a wonderful Kindle!
5,"Amazon Kindle Paperwhite - eBook reader - 4 GB - 6 monochrome Paperwhite - touchscreen - Wi-Fi - black,,,",My husband prefers the Paperwhite model over the Voyager because it is easier for him to hold in his big fat fingers since it has a larger frame so more room for the fingers. And Kindle Paperwhite and Voyager models are much easier to read for long hours than tablets (easier on the eyes). I have an iPad and still have a Kindle for reading. I highly recommend the Kindle Paperwhite and Voyager models.,Kindle Paperwhite

I've been a long time prime member who has many kindle books. I see this can be good for reading out side, it's lighter than a tablet and you don't have to charge it alot, the battery lasts a long time...Setup is straight forward and doesnt take alot of instruction to use it. It displays adds while its off, but it didn't bother me at all. It took me but a few minutes to setup and learn how to use the device.If you have prime you should see all your books right away but If you don't have prime but have someone in your house that does you have to setup a household and share everything to my wife so she was able to see all the books that i had purchased (i can be selective after they are shared). One thing i noticed was there is the kindle lending library, it only allows 1 book to be borrowed per month. Recently Amazon came up with Prime Reading, so you can take out multiple books at a time but you have to do it thru the web or a tablet or phone using the kindle app, which after they are taken out the kindle will see.",Kindle Paperwhite

I removed 1 star because the highlighting and note taking systems can get laggy, images are sometimes hard to zoom on, and you can't copy paste a quote.

5,"Amazon Kindle Paperwhite - eBook reader - 4 GB - 6 monochrome Paperwhite - touchscreen - Wi-Fi - black,,,","Purchased to replace an older model that died during a software update (lost wifi connection during the download, bricking the kindle). This model has 300dpi, up from 220 on the previous model. With text it is barely, if at all, noticeable. With any kind of graphics or cover images, the increase in resolution is nicer. Unfortunately the lighting remains uneven at the bottom of the screen as it was in the previous generation. The voyager model supposedly has better lighting but at twice the price it wasn't worth it to me. And the uneven bottom lighting isn't bad, but it is there and I would have thought Amazon would have fixed that by now. Maybe it is a limitation of having 4 light sources vs the 6 on the voyager. Still, the lighting is not bad and this is a very nice eReader. Noticed the background is a touch more beige than the grey on the previous model which is a welcome subtle change, easier on the eyes. Like too that the font is a dark grey versus pitch black which also reduces eye strain especially for those with dyslexia who can be sensitive to harsh contrasts. Overall, highly recommended. Best eReader for the price.",Excellent eReader

5,"Amazon Kindle Paperwhite - eBook reader - 4 GB - 6 monochrome Paperwhite - touchscreen - Wi-Fi - black,,,","As a book snob/purist - I put off buying a kindle for ages. After doing a lot of travelling and lugging around paperbacks, I decided it was time to grow up and get over it. While it may not have the satisfaction of turning a physical page, it makes up for it by weighing practically nothing, only having to have one hand free and being able to read it outdoors. Battery life is amazing - will last over a month with moderate use. Have been trying to convince all the other book lovers in my family to get one!.",In Love
5,"Amazon Kindle Paperwhite - eBook reader - 4 GB - 6 monochrome Paperwhite - touchscreen - Wi-Fi - black,,,",I purchased the reader for my wife to replace her old reader.

5,"Amazon Kindle Paperwhite - eBook reader - 4 GB - 6 monochrome Paperwhite - touchscreen - Wi-Fi - black,,,","My first tablet! I was surprised it's just like my Samsung phone, and actually can sync programs and data with it. The wireless is great; I have no need for cell capabilities. It would be more power usage to search for cell, and most places I can use wi-fi. I use it as an alternative Kindle reader with the Kindle app. I also was amazed to find a free Microsoft Office Word, Powerpoint, and Excel, etc, although I haven't used them. This Tab A is sometimes kind of slow, but it was about $100 on sale, and great for the price. Very versatile. I'm very happy with it. I haven't needed extra memory yet, but good to know I can expand it with a microSD card.","A bit low-powered, but nice"

You can carry it to café or library for reading. There is no harm to your eyes because of it specific technology. The only drawback is that it will flash when you turn the page. But this is the common problem for this kind of reading stuff. I think it is acceptable. I bought on the price of 99 with a 25 discount. So it really worth it.,GOOD QUALITY
5,"Amazon Kindle Paperwhite - eBook reader - 4 GB - 6 monochrome Paperwhite - touchscreen - Wi-Fi - black,,,",Best electronic reader.

5,"Amazon Kindle Paperwhite - eBook reader - 4 GB - 6 monochrome Paperwhite - touchscreen - Wi-Fi - black,,,","I had this device for few weeks before returning it and getting the Kindle Voyage. But the only difference between the two is the design, page press buttons and the auto dimming light as they both have the same screen. After purchasing this device, I immediately devoured three books in the course of a weekend. Which, sadly, is more than I've read in about two years. This device has reinvigorated my live for reading since it is so portable and the battery lasts for quite a while. I would suggest that you get the genuine leather cover for this device when you buy it as it just adds that little extra to the purchase. Overall, I would recommend anyone that wants to read more, reads often, or reads many books at once to take the plunge and buy this device. Plus, new books can be upwards of $20-$30 sometimes. This little device will carry all of your books and only costs the price of a few hard copy books. Plus if you need a physical copy, you can always borrow from the library.",Great Device for Readers

5,"Amazon Kindle Paperwhite - eBook reader - 4 GB - 6 monochrome Paperwhite - touchscreen - Wi-Fi - black,,,","But, this isn't a bad substitute. The print and light are easily adjustable. It's small and lightweight, easy to carry and holds a charge for a week or so. At the font size I use it takes 2 to 3 kindle page turns to equal 1 page turn of a book and thus I think I would prefer a larger screen. Although it's touted as better for the eyes than reading using the kindle app on a tablet, I really don't think that is the case for me.

Asked me to look on the kindle shelf and there was none. Then they said they could give me store credit, and I would go line up in checkout and order a new one. Since I got mine on a discount, I had to pay the price difference!! This is ridiculous. They wouldn't order a replacement for a defective product, unless I pay more??

5,"Amazon Kindle Paperwhite - eBook reader - 4 GB - 6 monochrome Paperwhite - touchscreen - Wi-Fi - black,,,","I was hesitant to buy a Kindle Paperwhite as I already owned an entry level Kobo that was about 6 years old. However, I'm goad that I upgraded as this device is smaller, lighter, and more ergonomic. Its a lot easier to hold for an extended period of time. Additionally, as part of the Kindle ecosystem, borrowing e-books from the library is a snap and no longer requires me to hook up to my computer.",Exceeded Expectations

5,"Amazon Kindle Paperwhite - eBook reader - 4 GB - 6 monochrome Paperwhite - touchscreen - Wi-Fi - black,,,","I had to replace my Kindle 3G keyboard after several years because it would no longer charge. So I got this one and I'm satisfied, but I really miss my 3G. The only feature that's better in the newer Kindle is the light. Turning pages is my main complaint with the touch screen. It sometimes doesn't register the touch and you have to do it again. Also going back a page is a pain. Supposedly the left 25% of the screen is for going back, but it seems like the left 10% at best and just to be safe I press on the very edge. I miss the buttons for turning pages.I also miss the 3G even though I didn't use it all that often. Now I just need to make sure I plan ahead on road trips.","Light is great, OK otherwise"

5,"Amazon Kindle Paperwhite - eBook reader - 4 GB - 6 monochrome Paperwhite - touchscreen - Wi-Fi - black,,,","So I love, love, love e-ink. I'm not even a big reader but t's this magic technology that no one seems excited about. There is literally ink inside the screen that moves up or down electronically. So it is literally an actual printed book page that can change in an instance.I like the Kindle Paperwhite and it does everything I need. But this particular version doesn't have the same pleasing page color as my 5 year old Kindle, which is strange. But I really needed the light to actually be able to read when I usually want to read. So when the light is on it's pretty nice.The interface is rather slow, which is to be expected given it's not a traditional LCD screen (it's literally a printing press), but I wish the interface had better ways to organize and change the order of books. The other problem I had was that the first one I received had a large hole in the upper layer of the screen (where the light diffuses through) so it had this glowing hole that reminded me of a giant stuck pixel. Also there were a few random stuck black spots. The next one did not have these problems. Amazon will replace it for you if it does.",I love e-ink. The Paperwhite isn't the greatest.

The Kindle Paperwhite is nice because of it being backlite she can read in the dark or ever outside in the direct sunlight. There is no glare whatsoever. The size perfect for her hands and do not get sore or achy as if she was reading a paperback book. If your looking for a device strictly for reading purposes only get the Kindle Paperwhite.

Similarly I see no point in upgrading from an old paperwhite until you really want a 300 ppi display. Kindle Paperwhite is good but not much has changed over the years, if you plan to upgrade over the old one think if it is worth spending.A paperwhite with 3G goes up towards 180-200 USD, I would rather invest the money on a tab.

5,"Amazon Kindle Paperwhite - eBook reader - 4 GB - 6 monochrome Paperwhite - touchscreen - Wi-Fi - black,,,","Ordering this online to pick up at the store was easy until I got to the store where, as usual, there were workers standing around yet I had to wait several minutes for someone to address me at the pickup desk then I had to wait to pay for it at the registers. I would have thought I could purchase it at the pickup center. Honestly, if it weren't for the increased risk of stolen delivery items during the Christmas season, I probably would have gone with Amazon to purchase the Kindle. (The price was the same through both retailers.)",This Kindle is great!

5,"Amazon Kindle Paperwhite - eBook reader - 4 GB - 6 monochrome Paperwhite - touchscreen - Wi-Fi - black,,,","I did my research, and this was the tablet I wanted. It was a smooth transaction. The only thing was that I couldn't purchase it ""without special offers"" from anywhere other than Amazon direct. I opted to purchase it from Best Buy ""with special offers"" because of the price. I was pleasantly surprised to find out that I could choose to have the ""special offers"" removed after purchase. I had to pay additionally for this option, but it could be done. None of the reviews I read mentioned that this was possible. I suppose this could change this at any time, but at the time I am writing this, it is an option.I saved delivery time by purchasing at Best Buy and paid minimally later to have the special offers removed.","can add ""without special options"" later"
