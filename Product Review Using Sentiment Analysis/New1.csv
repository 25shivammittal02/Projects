27,Apple iPhone 4s,1,met all expectations 
28,Apple iPhone 4s,1,phone was in great shape
29,Apple iPhone 4s,0,charger wa in pieces
30,Apple iPhone 4s,1,it took little longer than would expect an amazon item to arrive but the phone was perfect 
31,Apple iPhone 4s,1,would buy it again if do need another one later looked practically brand new and worked very well but saved ton of money 
32,Apple iPhone 4s,1,excellent
33,Apple iPhone 4s,0,battery problems
34,Apple iPhone 4s,0,it didn the microphone doesn work have to use head phone all the time 
35,Apple iPhone 4s,1,i lost my good phone while on vacation and needed temporary one until hit my upgrade period this phone was in good condition and works it is obviously and old model but had no issues activating it on my own the battery life is ok maybe day with light usage but this must be expected when buying an old phone 
36,Apple iPhone 4s,1,great phone would recommend it to any one who looking for i phone to buy 
37,Apple iPhone 4s,1,great condition for the price its super slow compared to the new iphones but does the job
38,Apple iPhone 4s,0,not bad phone at all except it stops vibrating for texts or other notifications every now and then even made sure the vibration was activated for the phone but other than that it alright 
39,Apple iPhone 4s,0,fast shipping in great condition but it was locked out and tried everything could to unlock it not seemed to work
40,Apple iPhone 4s,0,great phone however it not connected with sprint as advertised therefore its not sprint so the best option in buying expensive apple iphone must make sure that it can advertised as sprint phone 
41,Apple iPhone 4s,0,the phone came in great condition and on time was relived thinking would be able to activate this phone with my current sprint account and turns out it is not locked to sprint so if you are sprint costumer highly suggest you not waist your time and money on purchasing this phone if you are verizon costumer then you can use this phone because my sprint carrier said this phone was with verizon 
42,Apple iPhone 4s,0,works as expected 
43,Apple iPhone 4s,1,my phone works great it definitely little slower on the touch screen feature than new phone but have had no other issues with it 
44,Apple iPhone 4s,1,so far it seems to be great phone for that generation it came to us with the tiniest of tiny scratches on the face so that is awesome for recycled phone it works great

46,Apple iPhone 4s,0,first phone didn recognize at times during the day that it had battery at all the second phone ear speaker didn work tired of paying 35 to have phone number moved to the next phone
47,Apple iPhone 4s,0,worst cell phone ever it has all kinds of problems including all the basics it drops calls all the time by just turning itself of it can be turned of at all and the seller won communicate with me about these problems don buy anything here 
48,Apple iPhone 4s,1,came with everything it needs headphones and charger works great and compatible to connect with sprint with ease 
49,Apple iPhone 4s,1,great price and great condition the only problem and nothing to do with the product is that the 4s doesn work too well with the current apple os so it was super sluggish but besides that loved the purchase and served as the perfect backup phone for when my main phone takes an unexpected vacation into the toilet 
50,Apple iPhone 4s,0,did not work

53,Apple iPhone 4s,0,the item purchased was stolen
54,Apple iPhone 4s,0,i needed an iphone in short time frame so ordered one via amazon prime item was described as functional working condition and in acceptable cosmetic appearance so my expectations were low but didn need anything pretty upon receipt the iphone was filthy with built up grime in all crevices and there was yellow discoloration one side of the screen most likely due to screen replacement however this was just the beginning before noticed the functional issues for work use speaker phone frequently so the broken speaker and mic was disappointment then noticed the battery was draining far too quickly the battery was bad tried to pick up deal and got complete lemon you may get good phone but you re rolling the dice 
55,Apple iPhone 4s,1,this product exceeded my expectations am happy bought it 
56,Apple iPhone 4s,1,the phone came in great condition got it as if it were brand new it works great as well satisfied customer

80,Apple iPhone 4s,1,bought for my daughter she loves loves phone looks great no scratches perfect condition gave 4 stars because came with no charger
81,Apple iPhone 4s,1,great product replaced my android eve which grew to not being able to stand the iphone has no problems other than it being little more user friendly 
82,Apple iPhone 4s,1,i really like the phone seri isn as helpful as would like but over all the phone is great the picture on it is very clear
83,Apple iPhone 4s,0,product is good works fine but decided to stay with at and this is sprint asked for an exchange or to return it and no one replied to me so just make sure its exactly what you need and hope nothing changes because you re stuck with it reguardless of what policy is stated
84,Apple iPhone 4s,0,i ended up returning the phone ordered an iphone 4s for sprint when got it it was for verizon phone also the lock button didn work and then the back kept slipping off and lastly at the bottom of the screen it looked funky was frustrated cuz was gonna give it as gift to my fiancée emailed the seller and asked about it and they told me check this out they told me that somewhere which couldn find that it said in the description not compatible with sprint what it was advertised as sprint phone anyways the person started to argue with me and told me that was wrong nice anyways returned it and got my money back so thank them for that never going to buy from them again 
85,Apple iPhone 4s,1,it came with its original packaging earphones charger great condition no scratches no dents and works perfect love it 
86,Apple iPhone 4s,1,the phone works great it is definitely in perfect conditions it has great speed and all the functions need
87,Apple iPhone 4s,1,it an iphone think everyone knows what to expect always make sure you can verify it a clean esn with sprint of course seller was awesome 
88,Apple iPhone 4s,0,if you notice the customer feedback on rob house of good times is nothing but negative the seller is claiming to offer products but in reality has no intention whatsoever on providing them the seller just collects the money from the buyers and hopes that they do not notice and or care enough to file claim and get refund am glad went through amazon so know am protected but am very upset with how much of an inconvenience this has been if only had read all the feedback before placing my order with this person 
89,Apple iPhone 4s,1,the iphone is great the only problem had was the fact that the charger wasnt working luckily had my ipods charger and that worked for it overall highly recommend it
90,Apple iPhone 4s,0,i have bought iphone 4s and cheeped to angola but unfortunatly cannot use it because its locked and came with sprint sim nº icc id8901010 018633051660f card according to sprint assistant this stolen iphone and cannot be unlocked please revert asap
91,Apple iPhone 4s,0,the iphone does not work my service provider could not activate it because it still had an account associated to the serial number of the phone purchased as refurbished while the phone may work really don know because it can be activated the seller has been contacted and has not contacted me to resolve the problem why don know other than they are not reputable unprofessional and could care less about their customers either way would highly recommend amazon remove them as seller on their website am very disturbed and dissatisfied that could be ignored as customer and shown no respect about this issue will certainly pass this experience on to others many others hope amazon can lean on them to do what is right 330 rip off is completely unacceptable for any so called wanna be legitimate company hope can syndicate my feedback and get it to the right people 
92,Apple iPhone 4s,1,the phone arrived as promised and packaged well it did appear to be new phone complete with charger and ear buds the curious part came when tried to activate it went online at sprint and entered the activation number that found on the sticker on the outside of the box the system would not take it after three tries was connected to chat line was asked to once again enter the number and it was once again rejected was told to turn on the phone and check the number stored in the phone did and found it was different than the number on the box when we entered that number the activation was completed so was just curious why new phone would come in box that had different activation numbers otherwise 5 stars 
93,Apple iPhone 4s,0,i lost my money by buying this phone did not understand it was locked phone live in brazil and here there dont have sprint it was the worst purchase of my life is standing there in the drawer serves no 
94,Apple iPhone 4s,0,i received verizon phone not to mention it was used in the description it says new not used did not pay 400 dollars for this contacted the sell and amazon the seller sent me returning label on friday and sent it back friday so it should be there on tuesday just want my phone orders already my sprint iphone 4s 16gb new they better send it to me with in this week like they said they were am outraged amazon on the other hand said if they don they ll have to take matters in there own hands just want my phone they should send me free case or something now for there mistake mad mad mad 
95,Apple iPhone 4s,1,love the 4s compared to the 5 phone was practically brand new without blemish on it long time android user and am happy having made the switch 
96,Apple iPhone 4s,1,works awesome
97,Apple iPhone 4s,1,our first smart phones new as advertised they arrived in sealed original packages activated them on our ting account online in just few minutes we like them very much bit of learning curve for couple of 65 year olds used to flip phones but we are learning and best of all our kids have quit bugging us about our old flips 
98,Apple iPhone 4s,1,from long time droid user can say that have overcome my fear of the iphone and now prefer it over other phones used to be diabolical hater of this phone along with my friends craig rob and stephen who would have thought they would hate apple stuff thought all liberals yearned for the day they could lick the sweat from steve jobs sack metaphorically speaking of course anyway broke away from the thought process that had been embedded in my mind since my childhood about iphones and decided to try them out much to my surprise they are pretty cool maybe one day the other guys will come around if can ever get them to give up on this human centipede thing they ve been trying to do with each other overall review 5 stars d buy again

130,Apple iPhone 4s,1,thank you bought for my mom as replacement device price was right and will hopefully hold her over until she can upgrade thanks 
131,Apple iPhone 4s,0,the product is not what you wanted try to connect several times to the seller without any success the product had flaw in the letter does not work and asked for an unlocked phone and sent me locked phone
132,Apple iPhone 4s,1,i am bowled over by my phone not what expected for it arrived early and there was not scratch on the phone like brand new pleasant surprise thank you so much 
133,Apple iPhone 4s,1,over all very nice phone for the price the only sign of it being used was tiny scratch on the screen my only issue with the phone is that the power button on the top broke within 2 weeks of me using it have been able to use assisted touch to still use the phone but it is rather annoying 
134,Apple iPhone 4s,0,and the home button is crooked are you kidding me the phone works just fine otherwise but whoever refurbished this didn bother to clean it or put the home button back in properly the speakers headphone jack hole and the charging slot are all absolutely filthy and so clogged with dust am surprised they even work 
135,Apple iPhone 4s,1,this phone was exactly as described it has small chip on the top corner but you couldn tell especially if you had case on the phone had no problems contacting sprint and setting it up had the phone for about year before moved over to mobile
136,Apple iPhone 4s,1,very pleased with my purchase 
137,Apple iPhone 4s,0,totally bad experience the phone would not activate apple support person did not have clue what to do dont waste your time with those folks somewhere in the middle of trying to activate stood up to fast and the phone was jerked out of my hand it flew through the air and hit the tile floor where it was destroyed this thing blew apart not just the glass but the body too also bent now cant send back im out 75 
138,Apple iPhone 4s,1,great if are the one who sent me the meid so could check it with my phone carrier were quick honest and we love it 
139,Apple iPhone 4s,0,false advertisement don purchase ordered white sprint iphone 4s and received black verizon iphone 4s couldn use the phone at all purchased for my daughters 11th birthday however had to disappoint her read the reviews because they are true now have to wait to receive my money back 
140,Apple iPhone 4s,0,this phone is horrible it does not charge and when it is fully charged it only stays on for 15 mins plus when the phone charges it overheats needed this phone for work and one of my customers with dying 5 iphone stayed charged longer than this phone on 30 
141,Apple iPhone 4s,1,this was my first ever iphone purchase wanted to compare the difference from android to iphone this phone in particular when got it was in shock at how fast the phone was how quick it turned on was able to connect to wifi faster then my current phone at the time bought this phone as extra side phone for wifi use mainly only games etc well spent my moneys worth really did like the browser speed when you connect to the internet and get on chrome etc the updates to the phone let you know they need to be installed did like that security on the phone was also impressed with on locking the phone and how easy it was to set it up another positive will add to this liked how fast the games played on this there were numerous games downloaded where the speed of the phone kept up with the game keno games got my quite few times lol speed of the phone seemed to keep up also when had more then 1 screen at one point had so many apps between several screens it really did not affect the speed of the phone it charges quite fast even when was using it or playing games while charging it it charges fast the camera was very good quality even for smaller camera then am use to takes some getting use to takes pictures very fast love the quality easy to figure it out one of the main features bought this for to try out was siri it worked as read as it should you press the button ask her question and she really answers it it like another person hiding in your phone lol will be buying another iphone soon they are made for quick easy access to whatever recommend this phone to anyone its well made very fast and it does last 
142,Apple iPhone 4s,0,the phone is fine but they shipped it without sim card so have to go and pay for one now thanks alot

150,Apple iPhone 4s,0,it isn new and can be used because it is either stolen or tied to someone who is delinquent on their account 
151,Apple iPhone 4s,1,it was exactly the model wanted but it was my mistake when did not realize that it was not unlocked and my son could not use it where he is now living the sprint company does not work in the area he lives so returned the iphone just for that issue but delivery time return was also ok sorry for my mistake 
152,Apple iPhone 4s,1,the power cord was little damaged however it was shipped right away and the phone condition was accurately advertised there were no problems with getting sprint to activate the phone for me overall very pleased was reluctant as this was my first used phone purchase but relieved that everything turned out well

168,Apple iPhone 4s,0,i switched from samsung galaxy to this iphone turns out actually like the galaxy better will say one thing however about the iphone it is much more reliable than the galaxy as person who has owned several samsung phones believe me when say that the galaxy has some sort of major issue every 3 4 months and that my cellphone carrier charges me 10 month to send me refurbished phone every time the galaxy breaks this is the main reason switched to the iphone 
169,Apple iPhone 4s,0,didn work
170,Apple iPhone 4s,1,great phone in excellent condtion very happy with the purchase would definately do business with this seller again 
171,Apple iPhone 4s,0,the phone keep freezing up on me so have to go replace the phone and pay 270
172,Apple iPhone 4s,1,just as described thank you
173,Apple iPhone 4s,1,great customer service packaged professionally was checked for quality control was clear for easy sprint set up just as implied great communication when emailed concern about it arriving when was out of town they hustled and got it out to me same day and got it 3 days earlier awesome 
174,Apple iPhone 4s,1,power button stopped work after about six months but my daughter love the phone 
175,Apple iPhone 4s,0,this iphone 4s broke after 9 months of careful use 
176,Apple iPhone 4s,0,first want to say ordered iphone 4s on nov 12rd but you just gave me iphone4 
177,Apple iPhone 4s,1,always was away from iphone for many years it doesn mean that don like iphones but this is my first iphone and love it
178,Apple iPhone 4s,0,i was expecting an iphone 4s 16gb as the seller advertised however received an iphone 4 8gb was very displeased did not want to return it because was going out of town during that time and returning it would have been huge pain however the device received worked perfect and although it was not what expected it sold it to my friend and got some of the money back had horrible experience and do not know why they advertise something that is not true 
179,Apple iPhone 4s,1,it was replacement phone had lost my original iphone 4s and replaced it with the same model loved it then and love it now the seller delivered quickly and am very satisfied with his service 
180,Apple iPhone 4s,1,most people know what the iphone is all about so there no need for me to rant about the different features it has however what will say that this is true upgrade coming the blackberry torch 9850 didn upgrade because wanted to but because had to im happy ran into that obligation my choice of phones was between the 4s or the 5 wasn eligible for an upgrade until mid june of next year was force to buy phone for the full price and surprisingly both the iphone 4s and 5 were the same price 649 99 tax when compared both phone didn see any distinct feature that the 5 had over the 4s besides being faster and thinner so decided to buy the 4s from third party amazon saving me over 200 must say am very please with this phone now see why apply customer are nuts 
181,Apple iPhone 4s,0,there are few things would like to say about this 1 this item did not come in the original iphone box 2 the charger for the iphone does not work 3 when information from amazon was confusing at first during chat session the seller didn even read the pdf file attached to complaint including such confusing information and got customer service in very rude and unpleasant attitude was even threatened to be reported to amazon situation that never happened and have mails and evidence to proove it 4 got 10 usd in reward from amazon for the whole situation which does not compensate all went through conclusion still have locked phone with sprint with charger that doesnt work and my problem remains unsolved sorry but if there was chance to give medmedia246 half star or even negative rate would definetely do it 
182,Apple iPhone 4s,1,the item looks nice and compact or maybe too compact if your hands are big however applications are very practical and easy to learn 
183,Apple iPhone 4s,0,the phone was unlockable couldnt unlock the phone and it didnt really work good tired almost all the ways to unlock it but it didnt work the only way was to open new account with sprint and dont want to do that like seriously if make contract with sprint then can get new iphone for almost 200 but paid almost 450 for used onebad bad bad 
184,Apple iPhone 4s,0,got iphone it looked fine until after turned it on and the set up was complete then found that it was someones phone it still had all their text messages and contacts in it all there apps ect contacted srint to find that it is not lost or stolen and can be activated still the page said new iphone and it was not it had been activated for 4 months for 100 dollars more could have bought brand new one at retail price just be aware of what you re getting yourself into 
185,Apple iPhone 4s,0,it is not like new lier there is big huge scrach on the button lier lier lier 
186,Apple iPhone 4s,1,this seller was extremely helpful and willing to put in much appreciated extra effort so that would have my phone shipped to me quickly would recommend buying any product from this seller because they are trust worthy helpful and extremely kind had my phone expedited to me and it was no hassle or argument everything went smoothly and am very very happy

201,Apple iPhone 4s,1,so far so good
202,Apple iPhone 4s,1,has worked perfectly but did not totally seem to be brand new appeared to be refurbished but have no proof of that the phone looks great works great am enjoying it immensely 
203,Apple iPhone 4s,1,the phone was great in new condition we were very pleased 
204,Apple iPhone 4s,0,knock off product think screen seal failed shortly after purchasing and the screen protector was definitely not like past ones bought had dots all over it
205,Apple iPhone 4s,0,after 6 months having to this iphone 4s have had to change the battery twice which was 40 dollars each time also have had to many over heating speakers didn work and had to change twice as well
206,Apple iPhone 4s,0,it didn lock to sprint 
207,Apple iPhone 4s,0,this phone are unlocked for worldwild buy it and no working for venezuela don know what happened please answer me
208,Apple iPhone 4s,1,showed up in great condition exactly what was expecting 
209,Apple iPhone 4s,0,it was not locked to sprint it was locked to verizon 
210,Apple iPhone 4s,1,i don really care for the apple products because they are so hard to get your account set up for the app store but my daughter thought she needed iphone and guess they work pretty well
211,Apple iPhone 4s,0,worse
212,Apple iPhone 4s,1,everything came as he said thank you
213,Apple iPhone 4s,0,other than the fact that sprint service is almost nonexistent where live the main feature that was wrong with the phone was the volume you had to be very close to the phone in order to hear it and inerdz still made me pay to ship it back 
214,Apple iPhone 4s,1,great phone worked without issue for quite while eventually the screen stopped adjusting when turn it on its side but whatever it an old phone at this point highly recommended 
215,Apple iPhone 4s,0,screen scratches
216,Apple iPhone 4s,1,i bought my son replacement phone and when it arrived it was in great shape it look like new phone 
217,Apple iPhone 4s,0,sprint would not activate the phone they said it was lost or stolen the phone was in great shape when received it but could not be activated looked for phone to call to see if was doing something wrong but could not find one hope the return process goes well 
218,Apple iPhone 4s,1,there a little blurry spot at bottom of screen didn like that being on the screen not perfect 
219,Apple iPhone 4s,0,the iphone was represented as used which it was the description did not mention the otter commuter box which came with the iphone which was nice surprise however the iphone has been less reliable than my previous new phone was although how use the phone has not changed noticed the first day that the battery runs down faster and is sometimes depleted before the day is over new twist is that now cannot put some calls through when enter phone number to place phone call the screen indicates the call is connected because the seconds are incrementing however don hear ring or hear the receiving party this is inconvenient for phone wonder what feature will have reduced functionality next expected that phone although used would be more reliable and that its deficits would have been clearly described in the offering information even on amazon with highly ranked seller buyer beware 
220,Apple iPhone 4s,0,after having this phone activated found it was defective the volume was abnormally low even when turned up to the max took the phone in to the sprint store and they ran diagnostic test they did confirm there was an issue but could not do more than diagnostic without opening the phone procrastinated sending the phone back because wanted to remove my personal data and did not receive full refund won be order phone online again 
221,Apple iPhone 4s,0,when read the description it stated that the phone would have light minimal scratched on the screen the front and back screen were in great condition however there were many more issues the battery was toast and shut the phone off at 20 the metal frame is bent at the top of the phone making it hard to use case the flash doesn work the camera has dark spots the charger that came with the phone doesn work the speaker is blown and people can hear me contacted the seller and the response was quick but it was as useful as not contacting them at all they offered to repair everything minus the metal frame but d have to send the phone back on my dollar and be stuck without phone until they sent it back nothing else of course didn send it back be very cautious when buying 
222,Apple iPhone 4s,1,my phone works great love it did not need an iphone 5 so was pleased to get this for such great price 
223,Apple iPhone 4s,0,pos 
224,Apple iPhone 4s,0,i ordered these phones for my brother and niece and didn realize that they have to be unlocked for the particular phone service you use have since returned them for refund and my brother bought the correct ones locally 
225,Apple iPhone 4s,0,the phone is sprint but the sim card tray was not from original phone when took it to apple to have it activated they used the iemi from the sim tray that iemi was from an at phone which immediately locked the phone to at they did hard factory reset it is still locked to at it is an expensive paperweight now the phone was advertised to be in very good condition would say the chipped glass corners different sim tray the various scratches all over the phone is not very good maybe fair condition but no way in very good condition the seller refused to accept that there were irregularities with the iemi in sim tray versus the iemi within the phone the quality of the phone as stated above and he made excuses such as you were sent the right phone someone switched them in the mail would caution anyone purchasing used phone just don you want an iphone that works then please purchase new phone that is not locked to any carrier 
226,Apple iPhone 4s,1,my new iphone it is working great and do not more problem whit it thank you if see some ting better ill be by it
227,Apple iPhone 4s,1,the iphone is better than other like it so advice you can change it for your new phone cheap and good
228,Apple iPhone 4s,1,i love this not only did the phone come so perfect but it came in the original box with new headphones charger and one of the outlet cube chargers the phone did not have scratch on it either on top of all this it shipped so fast at first the phone was not fully unlocked but emailed her and she completely unlocked the phone for me would highly recommend this to anyone would also buy from this seller again she was wonderful the person who sold it to me was marsiffer book barn not this seller 
229,Apple iPhone 4s,0,tried to activate phone and sprint told me it was reported lost or stolen phone was brand new in the box beware when purchasing phones on amazon 
230,Apple iPhone 4s,1,this came with very few small scratches everything works and my daughter loves it would definitely recommend to someone else 
231,Apple iPhone 4s,1,got this for my son for christmas as replacement for his current phone the phone is still in great working condition 
232,Apple iPhone 4s,0,we received the phone quickly from vendor but had problems with phone and was never able to use the phone upon contacting the vendor there was no problem returning the phone the overall transaction was very professional just the out of pocket expense and wasted time which is at times unavoidable as for the phone since we did not get chance to use it not really sure how to rate the phone 
233,Apple iPhone 4s,1,the phone was what ordered had no issues and would use them again if have another need 
234,Apple iPhone 4s,1,i give to you 5 starts because you deserve it that experience with you was really great am very happy to have business with you once again thank you and keep doing like that 
235,Apple iPhone 4s,0,battery is totally shot very disappointed it turns off randomly total waste of money hopefully sprint will repair it smh 
236,Apple iPhone 4s,0,main button was defective and the wi fi broke after 1 month of purchase as this was used phone no warranty could be used found out that the wi fi problem is common 4s problem so do not blame this one to the seller but without any doubt the button thing is something that could be pointed out as this cell was sold as like new button works but not as smooth as it should have had previous iphones and ipads so this is definitely defective 
237,Apple iPhone 4s,0,they say this is new phone it is used phone not happy phone wouldn except icloud account c kevin somebody info was still in it bought this phone as gift for my mom very disappointed ended up taking the phone to the apple store where they told me this happens alot on amazon ppl saying the phone is new when it is not however apple was very nice took this amazon phone then gave my mom new iphone 4s right then there now we are happy will never buy from diamond wireless again if you buy this phone from them only hope you have better luck than we did with it

250,Apple iPhone 4s,1,great value bought used looks and works like new thanks
251,Apple iPhone 4s,1,excellent experience with this company bought an iphone 4s refurbished via them it arrived as expected but soon realized it had problem with holding charge and it would not turn off unless it was connected to the charger after research determined it had faulty charging port connector contacted jemjem and they worked great with me to provide many options to correct we settled on partial refund class act company 
252,Apple iPhone 4s,0,phone had no meid number so you can activate it with sprint completely bogus bought two identical phones from jemjem the other one had blown earpiece in the phone certified refurbished probably not very shady 
253,Apple iPhone 4s,1,love the iphones

263,Apple iPhone 4s,0,i bought this iphone because the one had broke but the phone is okay it cam package pretty well but after about month the speakerphone feature stopped working other than that guess the phone is okay if keep my head phones on all day and just talk through that

277,Apple iPhone 4s,1,exceeds expectations battery last all day and rarely force closes any apps it my first experience with apple software and haven had any problems using it 
278,Apple iPhone 4s,0,the phone is all cracked and lock button is stuck yet the description said used very good condition enough has been said 
279,Apple iPhone 4s,1,i love it but after two weeks had to get it replaced because the lock button jammed like it so much more than android though
280,Apple iPhone 4s,1,this phone was purchased to update from the iphone 4 know there isn a really big difference between the iphone4 and iphone 4s but to me can tell difference love the iphone 4s
281,Apple iPhone 4s,1,this iphone was brought for my son his other iphone was stolen and didn want to have to sign up for another two year plan took it to sprint to activiate activated with no interuptions just had to wait in the sprint store forever he is very pleased with the iphone would recommend buying from this merchant again the iphone came just as described it even came faster then expected which put smile on my son face and when he happy m happy thanks for the quick service 
282,Apple iPhone 4s,0,this is not unlocked phone there is debt against the phone or it is stolen it was cracked on the front and back from top to bottom do not like to be lied to this was my daughters birthday present and we are both upset and will never go to this company again 
283,Apple iPhone 4s,1,my phone is perfect no problems whatsoever am completely happy with it it was much cheaper this way than buying new phone from the company without an upgrade thank you very much 
284,Apple iPhone 4s,1,broke the screen on my old phone and didn want to pay full price phone works great came quickly would definitely buy from them again 
285,Apple iPhone 4s,1,no complaints was scared to order my iphone through amazon but have to say was very impressed 
286,Apple iPhone 4s,1,the phone was on sprint with sprint sim card think it is already unlocked perfect condition no problems just like regular iphone would work if your looking for cheap iphone 4s or in budget get this and if you are looking for five star or great reviews get this 
287,Apple iPhone 4s,0,the phone only work for 1 day and return it and still don get new phone or my money back and am very very disappointed because purchase the phone for my son birthday and to find out the is no good yes am upset 
288,Apple iPhone 4s,1,apple phone 4 is okay m not sure whats up with the phone bought that was used but at times the volume does not want to work properly and at different times it works just fine like it but its just like any other apple phone it screen will brake so fast with in just one drop so be sure to have very expensive protection for it would suggest water proof one 
289,Apple iPhone 4s,1,phone was in better condition than thought wife is very happy with purchase will buy one for myself soon 
290,Apple iPhone 4s,0,i bought my 4s phone don knowing that was locked for sprint use only and don know how to deal with that problem now and to pay s 50 month the sprint fee seems too much to use only month per year in usa 
291,Apple iPhone 4s,1,the phone was in great condition it had no scratches and it works perfectly none of the buttons were stuck or broken and the phone was just perfect 
292,Apple iPhone 4s,1,my grandson loves the phone no flaws that know of no scratches or cracks the only setback is that when we purchased the phone it was in the category of unlocked phones only trouble is it was not unlocked so we had to go with sprint contract which is 92 month when we were planning on using the phone with straight talk for 45 month so we are paying double what we wanted him to have 
293,Apple iPhone 4s,0,this is my second burn on trying to get phone once through craigs list and now amazon the phone says black when it is white one however that doesn bother me as much as the use of the phone have it up as loud as it will go and can barely hear whom am speaking to also can never hear it when have an incoming call have it as loud as it can go and miss calls all the time have tried to take pictures with it and they look blurred and brown same with shooting videos no am not happy with my purchase but am afraid if return it will get something worse 
294,Apple iPhone 4s,1,the phone is realy in goooood condition like new enjoyed it very much thank you for the shopping am very satisfied with the phone
295,Apple iPhone 4s,1,还不错 中国要用卡贴 支持联通移动2g 买来三天就被偷了not bad chinese use the card affixed to support china unicom mobile 2g bought was stolen three days oh

300,Apple iPhone 4s,1,i wish this could be perminant unlocked phone however with its listed price this should be good for people who don want conrtact 
301,Apple iPhone 4s,0,dont buy it from this person they are stolen whoever it is will send it to you with no esn on it so that means it stolen plus they are pretty much jipping you about 200 dollars 
302,Apple iPhone 4s,0,i purchased the iphone 4s through amazon to try and save money have tried to activate the phone through sprint only to find that it is stolen am returning the phone today and if my money is not returned will take legal action save the hassle and just don buy from this company keep in mind this review is solely rated to the seller not the iphone 4s

362,Apple iPhone 4s,0,speaker went out within the month was acting up from the day we received it but thought it was some error we had made in the settings never having an apple product before scared the hell out of us because when it was plugged in to charge the speaker made electrical shock type noise that due to the recent story of electrocution we avoided it like the plague but soon realized it was the death throws of the speaker so he was able to use it with headphones and begged me not to send it for return or repair two months later and it died intermittently resurrecting when it choice to sooooo we thought it was the charger so have bought 5 different ones until finally it gave up and completely out on him by then it was to late to get any type of help from the seller who just made rude comments about why waited so long and what wanted them to do about it months later when was just being polite and bringing the issues to their attention

459,Apple iPhone 4s,1,excellent an worked smoothly 
460,Apple iPhone 4s,0,it a china telecom version imei on the sim slot is erased physically so disappointed 
461,Apple iPhone 4s,1,phone works great looks good
462,Apple iPhone 4s,1,i adore this phone bought it to use with tracfone bring your own phone program and it has been dream activated the phone through the tracfone website and within two hours everything was transferred and working perfectly had been using samsung galaxy centura so even though this is not the newest generation of phones it feels magnificent updated to os 8 and it works even better had tried out freedompop free phone service for about month prior to buying this and was using samsung galaxy s3 but the service was so abysmal and unreliable that had to return it m so glad decided to try this couldn be happier 
463,Apple iPhone 4s,1,phone works great 
464,Apple iPhone 4s,1,good phone
465,Apple iPhone 4s,1,great 
466,Apple iPhone 4s,0,this phone was not originally verizon aand for the money that was paid can get on the internet unless am somewhere where someone has wifi very disappointing 
467,Apple iPhone 4s,0,the phone came with one screw missing and the other loose on the plugin for charging the battery goes dead overnight if not plugged into charger 
468,Apple iPhone 4s,0,at first glance the phone looked fine however the photo i took using my phone looks foggy upon closer inspection there are gouges crapes right on the exterior of the camera lens also while this is 3g phone it has difficulty connecting my partner has the exact same phone and when in the house or riding down the highway his will be on 3g while mine is on 1x whatever that is doing simple processes is delayed as if the processor or ram is having some problem
469,Apple iPhone 4s,0,you can hear from ear piece and the call screen disappears and every once in while letters and numbers flicker while in call phone had issues when shipped
470,Apple iPhone 4s,0,worked fine for 2 weeks and then the speaker went out
471,Apple iPhone 4s,0,save your money they claimed the phone was but it not ve had the phone 2 months and now have to pay 120 for new battery and new screen 
472,Apple iPhone 4s,0,product was defective not charging properly battery drains immediately even while on standby something that shouldn have been sold to us people just like to sell you anything even if they are aware of it being defective 
473,Apple iPhone 4s,1,phone works great and just as promised on the discription the only problem was paid extra for 2 day shipping and it actually took week but other then the wait everything came as expected
474,Apple iPhone 4s,0,the owner did not think it was relevant to make it clear that the iphone he she was selling was in fact broken and the screen would not even turn on even took the phone to best buy and had them examine it and was told that it was beyond repair therefore paid 250 00 for an irriparable iphone contacted the seller to see if could get my money back and was told that he she did not provide refunds but offered to sell me screen for the broken iphone that purchased this would not have fixed the iphone and the owner was just trying to scam me further am obviously not happy with my purchase and would advise anyone else against purchasing from this seller he she is scam artist and fooled me 
475,Apple iPhone 4s,1,great experience from beginning to end someone stole my first phone and ordered from another company at first and did not get what wanted was little hesitant at first but it turned out to be the best decision great customer service affordable price was able to use my amex points as well timely delivery and new out of the box condition phone what peace of mind 
476,Apple iPhone 4s,1,i bought this phone for my daughter 15th birthday she loves it it arrived in pristine condition we easily activated it at our local verizon store and it has been working perfectly ever since the seller provided great follow up to our order would absolutely purchase from this seller again 
477,Apple iPhone 4s,0,this is defective phone advertised under the precept of it being used very good condition advertised as slight water damage causing screen to have minor discoloration on top and bottom no crack screen which we discovered meant in reality that it was severely water damaged the camera didn work very good condition not it had replacement screen that was not properly connected to give complete visibility no crack screen of course not it was replaced the screen continuously jumped up and down and evenly went black which m not sure if that is better or worse than the minor discoloration on top and bottom of screen all within 3 hours of activating the phone this phone was in anything but good condition and dishonest semantics justified dishonest behavior and that is bad business dealing for such what thought was trustworthy site as amazon 
478,Apple iPhone 4s,1,phone came in box with accessories and works great was pleasantly surprised was just like new would recommend
479,Apple iPhone 4s,1,the truth is they are both fabulous pieces of equipment that we are all very lucky to have in our lives actually remember having 4 digit phone number and 5 people sharing the same line but for reasons subtle which am not even totally conscious of love my iphone and didn love my android 
480,Apple iPhone 4s,0,i recently bought an iphone 4s from this seller when it arrived it looked fine we went to verizon to set it up and here is where the problem started the camera light would not turn off the tech said that a sign of water damage and it was literally draining the battery at very rapid rate booked genius bar appointment at apple to see if it could be fixed when they opened up the phone they discovered it has been tampered with voiding the warranty and the light was not repairable contacted the seller who sent us another iphone 4s potential buyers read this given our issue with the last phone we booked another apple store appointment just to have the phone checked out it even worse this time around the apple tech said it had been tampered with and cautioned us to get rid of the phone as soon as possible when pushed him for details on what was wrong with the phone he said the phone had been tampered with to the point that it can be used for identity theft basically opening any accounts used on the phone and getting account information he wasn supposed to tell us this but thank god he did almost everyone know has banking app or email with very private information no matter how much it ends up costing you do not buy from this seller m fairly certain all of the positive reviews are from people who are none the wiser and never had their phones inspected by an apple tech remember that it takes over year to get your identity back if its stolen not worth it for used iphone 
481,Apple iPhone 4s,0,the product was not required because m blocked with the telephony company verizon try to unlock it but it is very expensive and keep him now the battery does not work and not to do lost my money please tell me that can do if can still return it thanks

488,Apple iPhone 4s,0,i return phone couldn be activated 
489,Apple iPhone 4s,1,this phone works as expected it does have front and rear cameras and the video and photo quality is very good getting it activated with straight talk was chore but it can be done you don need the expensive activation kit to activate it just go to the straight talk web site and get an activation number most likely you will still have to call straight talk to activate the phone 
490,Apple iPhone 4s,0,i ordered this new iphone on august 2nd and the battery was bad from the start so called the apple company for my 1 year warranty you receive from any new apple product but as was talking to the people from apple they informed me that my phone had been used 3 years prior to me even receiving my phone so was unable for the warranty this phone is not new and now only 2 months later my phone is unable to even turn on due to the previous use recommend ordering it right from phone provider such as verizon sprint at etc due to the scams like this seller has going on

547,Apple iPhone 4s,1,very pleased with this product however it was missing the earphones that were suppose to be included as stated in the ordering information 
548,Apple iPhone 4s,0,this phone that ordered from this cadaml was piece of crap the speaker was busted on it and it didnt work properly after trying to fix it not aware that there was month had to get it back to this sorry ass vendor wrote him when finally gave up on it and it was to late to do anything with and he told me and quote the speaker works perfect and you had the phone for month the phone was in perfect condition when sent it the phone had insurance from ups take it up ith them no refunds you had for over month with insurance from ups it no telling what conditions the phone is in now now tell me this how do you figgure that you get insurance from ups ok 4013

550,Apple iPhone 4s,1,very happy with the iphone other than small chip on the corner of the phone it works perfectly it arrived in great timing 4 days and was able to activate the phone with no problems am very pleased with this product and would recommend buying from this user again 
551,Apple iPhone 4s,1,i don like the prices am not impressed with their customer service the thing is their products perform brilliantly have ipad iphone mac pro and itouch in the house they are easy to use and trouble free just wish they weren so greedy and they manufactured devices in the states their history of exploiting workers in china is terrible especially considering the profit margin they maintain 
552,Apple iPhone 4s,1,i am very busy and use my phone lot for business am always hesitant to get new phone because hate to figure it out this iphone 4s has been the easiest phone that have ever owned and it fun 
553,Apple iPhone 4s,1,i had an issue with verizon getting the phone activated these guys were incredibly responsive and helpful getting something resolved that in the end actually had nothing to do with the phone they sold me as for the phone itself it came in great condition rob
554,Apple iPhone 4s,1,phone is in excellent shape physically screen has some lighting image burn issues and battery life is not like new but then again the phone isn new so that to be expected suppose 
555,Apple iPhone 4s,0,wifi didn work on this phone it wasn from lack of trying liked other features of this phone and that why gave it 3 
556,Apple iPhone 4s,0,i will never shop at amazon again to this date still cannot use the phone purchased because there was no user name and pass word to unlocked the device and to make things worst the website that was provided to unlocked the phone was not able to do so
557,Apple iPhone 4s,1,nice phone for good price if you need new phone and it not time for an upgrade under your contract this is the way to go 
558,Apple iPhone 4s,1,as expected rode in white horse drawn chariot along side me was elppa the road littered with decomposing
559,Apple iPhone 4s,1,it is good no problems so far it isnt slow and got it set up nice and easily good stuff
560,Apple iPhone 4s,1,i found this phone to be good purchase it arrived on time and as it was described have yet to find any fault with it 
561,Apple iPhone 4s,1,i was very unsure about purchasing this phone at first especially due to some of the reviews but them being old reviews just took the risk and purchased it anyways received it today and so far everything seems to be working just fine already comes with ios7 installed and original charger and cable come with it as well phone is used it has normal wear on the silver edges but nothing to the point of complaining also got it activated without problem 
562,Apple iPhone 4s,1,i have enough to buy 4s product performance is perfect the internet phone messages are very good very grateful to the s amazon warehouse to give me such perfect product 
563,Apple iPhone 4s,0,the phone is received was more than excessively scratched up it took verizon 2 hours to activate it and it overheating as we speak in my hand ve literally had it activated for all of 5 hours fully charged it and it battery is already dead the description is nothing like what received this morning m beyond pissed 
564,Apple iPhone 4s,0,these phone keeps on turning it self off and the battery life last on like 3 hours or less so if there is any one who knows what up let me know it it a hassle to return it 
565,Apple iPhone 4s,1,outstanding used phone received very fast no problems setting it up looks new 
566,Apple iPhone 4s,0,we ve had some problems with it 
567,Apple iPhone 4s,1,very nice phone works great only wish had spent the money and got the new model with larger screen
568,Apple iPhone 4s,1,bought this for my son college haven heard any complaints that a very good sign 
569,Apple iPhone 4s,0,not new phone from manufacturerphone had finger prints on it upon opening phone info was taped to phone not on box as new apple phone used bluetooth to setup my phone and add all personal info and passwords phone internet and apps shut the bluetooth of to set phone sounds and learned the speakers do not work plugged the phone in to charge when checked it it was dead and found it wont charge 
570,Apple iPhone 4s,0,the phone is being returned because the battery would not charge properly the phone appeared new and never had the apple store check it out so it may or may not be refurb returned or used one remember that these 4s phones were all built at the same time so that means that even if you get new phone it will have an ancient battery the phone would take an inordinately long time to charge and would never get up to 100 after three weeks it got so bad that was trying to charge it almost all day long and had to put it into airplane mode so that it could even get up to 40 charge would recommend that anyone buying an older phone be very careful to see that the phone charges normally right out of the gate if it does not send it back 
571,Apple iPhone 4s,1,received phone it was in great condition 
572,Apple iPhone 4s,1,awesome condition very clean no problems at all
573,Apple iPhone 4s,1,the 4s is great phone never realized how great until it was trade in time and got droid phone sure my iphone is only 3g but don use the hotspot feature that much to really care as an internet client browser it is excellent in terms of functionality well all of it apps work can say the same thing for my android phone sure have mac mini at home and everything integrates well which is how it should all work actually do some mac programming and m long time unix lover so the mac is perfect for me my phone which runs the latest and greatest os does so and will continue to because apple doesn fragment their ios distro unlike other companies there is basically one platform which makes life simple for developers enough of this stuffthe bottom line is that it works from siri to browsing texting and integrating with my desktop when it finally dies ll get new iphone foxcomm might suck as company but they make some great products 
574,Apple iPhone 4s,1,looked brand new even though it used works great love the design and the iphone is the best phone
575,Apple iPhone 4s,1,i needed replacement phone as ruined my iphone 5 last october the phone arrived in timely fashion great appearance but better yet it has been working flawlessly plan to get one for my husband 
576,Apple iPhone 4s,1,i was skeptical about buying phone online but did lot of research and was careful to pick reputable seller also checked that the imei had been cleared and that the phone was set up for my carrier received the phone promptly and had no problem setting up the service the phone is just like brand new but paid about half the price love it 
577,Apple iPhone 4s,1,highly recommended from here came good as new and no problems works perfectly fine and couldn enjoy it anymore than do 
578,Apple iPhone 4s,1,they did such an incredible time the phone got here before it was scheduled and is in tip top shape runs perfect and they are very efficient highly recommended 
579,Apple iPhone 4s,1,going from an android to and iphone there much of difference like the iphone more the only reason am not giving it 5 stars is because the screen cracks quickly ve had the phone for 2 months and my screen is already cracked 
580,Apple iPhone 4s,0,we ll the company that shipped the phone either messed up with fedex or fedex messed up either way didn get the phone when was supposed to but that isn what bothered me per se what bothered me is when was activating the supposed new phone found out through verizon that the phone had two previous owners contacted the company that is the go between with amazon and they blew me off in the end they just beat me through attrition 
581,Apple iPhone 4s,0,you bought phone that was supposed to be new and was refurbished you send it me on napkin whitout charger or accesories and when return it rather than returning me 300 dollars that pay for it you only give me 200 dollar abusive get unable to retur 80 percent at least 
582,Apple iPhone 4s,0,i got the phone from reputable seller the phone was shipped within couple hours of purchase it arrived to my office within 72 hours the phone looked like 8 10 with the described surface damage it looked great however on the first attempt at an incoming call it is sent directly to voicemail and it never rings on my end only when the outside caller attempts to redial does the phone ring so the result was ton of missed calls for my business which cannot afford 
583,Apple iPhone 4s,0,wasn unlock had to ship it to the states to get apple to unlock it
584,Apple iPhone 4s,1,works great 
585,Apple iPhone 4s,0,it wasn a 4s it was plain 4 
586,Apple iPhone 4s,1,phone arrived promptly exactly as described looks and works like new no problems getting it set up on my account 
587,Apple iPhone 4s,1,very good phone
588,Apple iPhone 4s,1,my iphone purchase was easy to search find what was looking for the process was secure and best of all my phone was exactly what was stated in the description it also arrived four days before the suggested arrival date awesome 
589,Apple iPhone 4s,1,the phone arrived on time and was in perfect condition works great love it 
590,Apple iPhone 4s,0,very slow
591,Apple iPhone 4s,1,i was very pleased at first with the iphone 4s after about two weeks the screen quit working but then few days later it started working again now so far so good working great it may have been something did who knows thanks

593,Apple iPhone 4s,1,the iphone came in on time and was in good working condition still going good after 2 months will upgrade to 5 stars after 1 year jay
594,Apple iPhone 4s,0,this iphone could not be used in the s and was only formatted for use in asia do not purchase it was total scam 
595,Apple iPhone 4s,0,he recibido el iphone bloqueado además la caja indica 16gb la etiqueta del iphone indica 32gb la pantalla se aprecia es usada en resumen teléfono bloqueado usado received the iphone locked but also the box indicates 16gb and the label or dtiker on iphone indicates 32gb besides the screen ir display have mark as is used in summary the phone os locked altered and used 
596,Apple iPhone 4s,1,does everything that want m sure there are more sophisticated phones on the market but this phone is beyond my capacity to use all its functions well worth the price 
597,Apple iPhone 4s,1,the bike was purchased as used like new and it indeed arrived used like new great condition with headphones and everything 
598,Apple iPhone 4s,1,finally switched to smart phone and am very happy with this iphone still learning how to use it but so far all is great
599,Apple iPhone 4s,1,bought for my wife found the camera on the 4s is even better than my samsung s4 which is 13m 
600,Apple iPhone 4s,0,unfortunately it doesn stay charged it also shuts itself off whenever it feels like it we are disappointed with that 
601,Apple iPhone 4s,0,i chose this phone because so many friends and family had and love them takes great picture actually has voice that talks to you for help does smart phone functions looks great easy navigation nice looking cons returned to seller does not accept all cdma carriers only verison for this phone antiquated technology cannot add memory cannot replace battery very small screen went to samsung galaxy 4s 
602,Apple iPhone 4s,1,this is my first smart phone and am learning how to use it so far can say that it is easier to store phone numbers in than regular phone 
603,Apple iPhone 4s,1,i chose this to replace lost phone because of its comprehensive description which proved to be accurate had no trouble activating it and it seems to be functioning as expected it came well packaged within the expected time frame 
604,Apple iPhone 4s,1,the phone arrived quickly and looked like new works well 
605,Apple iPhone 4s,0,my husband is landscaper and he hadit for week with the otterbox and it got damp not wet but damp in his pocket and it stopped working 
606,Apple iPhone 4s,0,the phone wasn new like the listing had said it works fine but the left hand speaker is broken and it makes it sound weird 
607,Apple iPhone 4s,1,came in timely manner works perfect had it for month now and love it 
608,Apple iPhone 4s,1,this came in timely manner am happy with my purchse
609,Apple iPhone 4s,1,the unit was gift to my grandson as of yesterday it was working fine there is limitation in programming because vzw will not provide all the perks as used phone and not from their source would suggest that the purchase of used iphone has such limitations and not through the fault of seller this buy was bargain but suspect vzw and others wish to control how adaptable to changie like new assets of their phones should be especially in older ones any way teenager gets some peer approval as well as features not on flip model 
610,Apple iPhone 4s,0,ear phones didnt work
611,Apple iPhone 4s,1,like any bite this is sweet apple
612,Apple iPhone 4s,1,as described

622,Apple iPhone 4s,0,does not stay charged shuts down unexpectedly at inopportune times 
623,Apple iPhone 4s,1,i got my phone even sooner than expected was very scared to buy something like this used the only reason didn give it 5 was the charger it came with short and actually started smoking on the first night used it kinda scary just replaced it and everything else works beautifully 
624,Apple iPhone 4s,0,i ordered brand new iphone 4s but instead was supplyed very badly refurbished one there are signs that this has been used before the metallic side strip is damaged in more than two places the authorized apple store says it has chinese parts and it is badly refurbished
625,Apple iPhone 4s,0,i bought this phone as an unlocked phone but later found upon revving it found out that it was locked with verizon felt cheated because was not expecting this from amazon seller of the phones 
626,Apple iPhone 4s,1,straight forward and good purchase only complaint is that the charger that was included with the phone is fragile and doesn work needed to get new charger but overall was happy with the purchase 
627,Apple iPhone 4s,0,everything jst as it said except for the lock phone which have to spend few more to get unlock
628,Apple iPhone 4s,1,timing of product was great it was here the first day it said it would be had couple technical issues but the seller was in contact immediately to answers questions phone was in great condition and was in it original packaging like the description said overall this very pleasant to deal with and hope to be able to purchase other products in the first
629,Apple iPhone 4s,0,the phone is in good condition the ear phone plug area is little shaky overall the phone is working well 
630,Apple iPhone 4s,1,phone is almost pristine condition and works great exactly as it was advertised great price and worth it 
631,Apple iPhone 4s,0,i got an amazon gift card when did my taxes that was my first mistake once got the card had to spend it looked at phones and ordered cheap iphone but after month realised it was not coming have asked for my money back 
632,Apple iPhone 4s,1,i love my new iphone would recommend this to anyone looking to buy smart phone such great deal too thank you 
633,Apple iPhone 4s,1,great phone so decided d had enough with verizon crap with my old plan didn want to lose my unlimited data and didn want to pay full retail price for new phone to upgrade my wife old samsung first generation junker so made vow to search amazon for good deal and sure enough one was found no matter what you are looking for you can find it here 
634,Apple iPhone 4s,1,just like the advertisement said but the free case was pink seriously battery also seems shorter than typical even for an iphone 
635,Apple iPhone 4s,1,its great product but is little on the fragile side given the amount of class in the phone 
636,Apple iPhone 4s,1,wonderful phone one of the best phones have ever had would recommend this to all of my friends and family 
637,Apple iPhone 4s,1,prefect amazing iphone love it it is an amazing phone great function and more details the person is still very nice all in all nice job 
638,Apple iPhone 4s,0,the iphone 4s is pretty awesome but it helps if the product wasn reported lost or stolen when calling to activate it to my phone number 
639,Apple iPhone 4s,1,just love it wonder what took me so long had to buy book about how to and will learn siri soon great product
640,Apple iPhone 4s,1,thank you so much fast and works perfect if didn fid that don think would have gotten another iphone
641,Apple iPhone 4s,0,i owned smartphone prior to the iphone it was way more user friendly the apps were more user friendly and all my music downloads and ring tones were free the only thing like better on my iphone is the camera however think the process to upload my photos is more difficult on the iphone had thought face time would be nice but found out could use an app with my smart phone that is free for face time 
642,Apple iPhone 4s,1,i purchased this item as xmas gift must say the item arrived way begore schedule checked out the authenticity and all was good im very happy 
643,Apple iPhone 4s,1,on the phone while appearance scratch and deficiency did not provide the directions but does not affect the normal use the price is very affordable 
644,Apple iPhone 4s,1,unfortunately my purse was stolen 3 weeks ago with everything in it including my iphone was at loss naturally was very apprehensive about ordering phone online because mine was stolen have to say that so completely pleased with the person chose the phone works great had no issues activating it arrived before axle cited it to would absolutely order from them again refer them as well thank you so much 
645,Apple iPhone 4s,1,the apple iphone 4s is new and am still trying to learn how to use it one thing do not like about the phone is the difficulty adjusting the ear volume have just read online how to do it ll try later would apprecite it if apple provided diagrams and detailed instructions do not feel that should have to go out and buy dummies book to learn how to use an expensive smartphone the design of the iphone 4s is beautiful the icons are colorful and bright very much like that can watch the stock market on the phone am very surprised that it is so easy to hold in my small hand and it is so light it is very comfortable phone to use can see that it can become an addictive tool for every day life phone calls messages reminders calendars notes 
646,Apple iPhone 4s,1,i was very nervous about ordering this phone used and online unseen but received it and it is in great condition came with an old case but had already ordered an otterbox so replaced it quickly also downloaded the new ios so happy with this phone happy with the delivery ve had an iphone before so it feels good to be back 
647,Apple iPhone 4s,1,i purchased this through amazon warehouse deals it was as described condition little wear but looked like new in case found after had service that the phone 4s has glitch with the wi fi turning grey it makes the wi fi unable to be turned on contacted apple to see if it just needed an upgrade and they let me know since it was not purchased through them there was nothing they could do it was manufacturer issue that would need to be replaced if wanted wi fi capabilities don have unlimited data so it will not work for me contacted them and they were prompt in resolving my issue and when the phone arrives back they will give me refund will try once more on purchasing the phone 4s and hope it has working wi fi 
648,Apple iPhone 4s,1,this is an early xmas gift to my 13 yr old granddaughter as replacement for the one she had her old phone did not work properly anymore live in kansas and she lives in redwood city ca hence was hopeful that the phone would be as it was described by the seller have learned that except for getting it on their verizon plan my granddaughter is thrilled with her like new phone am very grateful to the seller and customer service who answered all of my questions

687,Apple iPhone 4s,1,arrived on time for christmas this iphone was like new in pristine condition the only reason for four stars is the charger and cable were not functioning once replaced both with my ipod the iphone charged it works perfectly and has already given many hours of fun to one of my grandsons rma was for want of cable and charger only so did not return package because all or nothing and this unit was perfect on its own

693,Apple iPhone 4s,1,the phone is in like new condition and it was exactly as it was described am extremely happy with this purchase 
694,Apple iPhone 4s,0,although this verizon iphone 4s is in great shape for used one have not been able to use its international gsm capabilities abroad because has been blocked by verizon with the complicity of apple the later does not unblock the iphone without previous approval from verizon and verizon does not unblock the international gsm capabilities of this units unless the owner me or anyone is verizon customer in good standing for at least two months sound like monopoly seems unfair sure it is call verizon global services and they told me that story and said that should try that amazon warehouse the seller unblock it on my behalf tried to make it work with kolbi 3 5g costa rican network using its sim card buy the cellphone keep on asking verizon unlocking code 
695,Apple iPhone 4s,0,i needed new phone becuase broke my other one so selected new iphone got this phone in the mail and everything on it works fine and runs like it should as for the charger got it was used charger and didnt work at charging my iphone contacted customer service and they told me to contact apple contacted apple then went back to the seller to try and get my ac charger replaced or have them send me new one niether has happened very disappointed in the customer who is selling this product bottom line is phone is great seller is terrible 
696,Apple iPhone 4s,1,i received exactly what was promised and in timely manner recommend amazon to anyone will actually be purchasing another in the next couple of months 
697,Apple iPhone 4s,1,we got an iphone 4s and are very happy with the product it came in an unopened package as advertised we took it to verizon and had no trouble getting our number transferred to it would definitely buy from these guys again 
698,Apple iPhone 4s,0,very bad hull serious badly sim locked no use it need me waste much money for unlocking but verzion no supporting for unlocking sadly

733,Apple iPhone 4s,1,great value
734,Apple iPhone 4s,0,returned it 
735,Apple iPhone 4s,0,i was disappointed with the size of the damage on the top of the screen large part of the screen is missing it had said there was crack but it more like chunck of the screen fell out 
736,Apple iPhone 4s,1,i thought it would have come with sim card
737,Apple iPhone 4s,1,had few problems with os and had to replace battery after 2 years of use 
738,Apple iPhone 4s,1,i received the apple iphone on time and the phone arrived as it was described there were no visible scratches or anything dan was very helpful when it came to answering questions about the phone thanks 
739,Apple iPhone 4s,1,product came as described in excellent condition standard shipping was very fast ordered on the 12th and got the 15th got email same day ordered saying it already shipped set up with verizon already and working great came set back to factor settings ready to go very pleased 
740,Apple iPhone 4s,1,i received it right
741,Apple iPhone 4s,1,the item seems great thanks 
742,Apple iPhone 4s,0,this phone would not completely charge ever if it was as much as 50 charged and used it to take picture or send message the charge would drop to zero returned it and the seller gave me full refund just lemon guess 
743,Apple iPhone 4s,1,after going through several android devices that even broke on me or just didn have the feel for what was looking for have finally found one that seem to be pretty satisfied with the battery life on this thing is amazing unlike my other phones that would have to charge at least once or twice day this phone can last me all day before really need to charge it 
744,Apple iPhone 4s,0,the phone didn work had to go through my insurance to get new phone that worked and it cost me another 160
745,Apple iPhone 4s,1,i purchased this for my neice because the one bought for my son at christmas from this same seller was great it arrived just like new in case with charger and shrink wrapped presented like new was so impressed will purchase from this seller again if needed 
746,Apple iPhone 4s,0,i was very unsatisfied with this product when received it it was not 4s at all as advertised was purchasing this from private party though was however very pleased with amazon with their rapid response to my complaint notified amazon as soon received this product and they refunded my money 
747,Apple iPhone 4s,1,this company was truly on the roll the phone looked brand new the order was at my door in about 3 days they also responded to my questions right away before made the purchase and that made me fill even better about ordering from this company up the phone will function as well as this companies service 
748,Apple iPhone 4s,1,this purchase exceeded my expectations was little afraid of buying phone other than new but this phone was in great shape and had no problems with the hook up 
749,Apple iPhone 4s,1,the product is very newly very like it think it is good product it can become my best phone
750,Apple iPhone 4s,0,the wifi has problem can work and the battery is very bad only can work few hours is bad shopping 
751,Apple iPhone 4s,1,the only problems is the phone doesn continue to remind you that you missed telephone call the ring tone could be elevated it is too soft 
752,Apple iPhone 4s,0,i recieved the phone and it only worked for about month then it wouldnt ring on the phone text or alarm settings 
753,Apple iPhone 4s,1,since there are already lot of reviews of the phone m going to focus on the experience of buying refurbished one the phone arrived in used iphone 4s box that had seen better days inside the box was plastic tray with single compartment containing the phone the compartment was much larger than the phone so the device was not actually secure in the packaging under the try found the charger and small booklet as expected buy lot of refurbished electronics and it looks like in this case the seller may use the term refurbished bit loosely based on the packaging the phone was in good condition but had some trouble finding the esn it was on label on the outside of the box and for some reason someone had placed another label over it making the numbers hard to read fortunately the esn is available on an iphone in the about screen on the phone activating was easy and this replaced my current phone rather than requiring new line the phone is in good condition and the battery seems fine in retrospect saved bit of money over buying from the manufacturer but would probably feel bit more comfortable about the device had gone that route instead 
754,Apple iPhone 4s,0,they said phone is new but registered from someone else and phone is broken and screen has been changed 
755,Apple iPhone 4s,0,microphone doesn work to make or receive calls
756,Apple iPhone 4s,1,i was replacing lost 4s and this was exactly the thing needed good description and the unit performs well

780,Apple iPhone 4s,0,you ll need to carefully inspect items from this seller as soon as they arrive one of the iphones bought definitely had defective battery and caught that early on and sent back for repair now see that the black phone battery won even last through the day and will need to be replaced also

800,Apple iPhone 4s,1,quality iphone 
801,Apple iPhone 4s,0,this listing is deceiving just got off the phone with apple to find out the device was purchased back in october not june as my purchase order was made this makes difference in the warranty as the device you are purchasing may not be under standard warranty or may be previously used 
802,Apple iPhone 4s,0,came from uk voice mail locked to uk software corrupted in short crap
803,Apple iPhone 4s,0,had the iphone for 3 weeks when it started to turn off on its own unable to restart it keeps showing the blinking apple and when it does finally work m unable to send text or use any applications this is my only phone so my frustration is very high tried connecting it to itunes and it corrupted my itunes account and when tried to delete and reinstall itunes it put virus in my computer what mess very displeased 
804,Apple iPhone 4s,1,great phone love it it just like the owner said new phone works good love this kind of phone
805,Apple iPhone 4s,0,when tried to activate the phone was told the phone had been reported lost or stolen so obviously could not be used the only positive thing can say is that the seller did refund the purchase with minimal hassle 
806,Apple iPhone 4s,1,the battery can be used only half an day when listen music or watch movie or play games if in the standy model it can be used for one day 
807,Apple iPhone 4s,1,arrived in excellent condition functions flawlessly and worked right out of the box for my mother christmas gift worth it
808,Apple iPhone 4s,0,had 5 lost it and replaced with 4 poor choice though cheaper calendar always out of sync for time zone not user friendly 
809,Apple iPhone 4s,1,this seller was great even sent me an upgrade phone from what was in the desciption didn arrive on the date it was suppose to but he refunded me some of my money back would definitly recomend this seller to anyone they were very understanding and would take care of any issues you have would defenitly go back to this seller for any of my wireless needs also this seller is very good about contacting you if needed very happy with the phone everything works and looks like its brand new would actually rate this seller on scale 1 10 would rate them big 8 because evrything almost went as planed thanks so much for everthing kevin
810,Apple iPhone 4s,1,the speaker for the phone didn work at first but after cleaning it worked like new pretty happy with the purchase 
811,Apple iPhone 4s,0,i bought an iphone 4s and can not talk on it because the mic does not work this is the way the phone came 
812,Apple iPhone 4s,0,my wifi for the phone is not turning on anymore you gave me useless phone and now have to get new phone
813,Apple iPhone 4s,1,works great
814,Apple iPhone 4s,1,i previously had an iphone 4 but the device had mind of it own the screen would go black then come back on at will tried all software resets but bought this used iphone 4s for less than having the the older model repaired 
815,Apple iPhone 4s,0,the home its wrong
816,Apple iPhone 4s,1,better than had hoped great deal wish had bought two
817,Apple iPhone 4s,1,was new
818,Apple iPhone 4s,0,i bought this phone which was listed as new it came in an unsealed iphone 4 box it is 4s phone sent an email and they gave me 10 credit the headphones that came with the phone are knock offs and have horrible sound am pretty sure this phone was refurbished and am disappointed they could list it as new would not have bought refurbished or used phone after few months the power button no longer works and once the screen froze there is nothing could do to power it down 
819,Apple iPhone 4s,1,works great 
820,Apple iPhone 4s,1,exactly as advertised great 
821,Apple iPhone 4s,1,exactly as advertised
822,Apple iPhone 4s,0,it was ok for year but slowed down after that
823,Apple iPhone 4s,1,with the holidays and such the item was slow in getting to me but once it came it lived up to my expectations 
824,Apple iPhone 4s,0,not only was this not an iphone 4s it was an iphone 4 when we decided to keep it anyway and activate it verizon refused to activate it as it was listed as lost or stolen phone this was christmas gift and pretty much ruined christmas for us we returned it and received refund used amazon instead of buying locally to avoid this type of situation was told would be given an amazon credit for all of my trouble and have yet to see that 
825,Apple iPhone 4s,1,i had droid phone that switched for this one it took me few days to get used to it but really love it this phone is my first iphone so my review may not be all that fair noticed that most of the apps that had running on my previous phone seemed to run better on this phone plus this phone had siri she really fun to have only had one complaint about the phone itself in the text messaging it doesn have colored flashing light to let you know that you have messages waiting it not deal breaker though can adapt overall this is really great phone 
826,Apple iPhone 4s,1,got to me in great timing was hekoed quickly and efficiently when problem arose with activting it it like brand new could recommend the store to anyone great quality in everthing thank you 
827,Apple iPhone 4s,0,bought this to replace stolen phone hoping to fill my contact and longer with this replacement phone bad luck with bad replacement phone ripped off twice 
828,Apple iPhone 4s,1,i received my iphone 4s within 3 days and in very good condition as it was described in the ad it was almost brand new and no cosmetic blemishes whatsoever when went to activate the phone on my existing verizon account there were no issues at all everything worked out wonderfully m very satisfied
829,Apple iPhone 4s,0,it was advertised as verizon phone but in reality it was sprint phone completely useless to me considering my provider is verizon 
830,Apple iPhone 4s,0,i was looking for new iphone and purchased from kj industries because they said they had new one when we got the phone it had pictures on it and we weren able to activate the phone because sprint said it was stolen contacted amazon and they said had to go through the seller he did contact me to say that he had to get the phone first before he gave me my 300 00 back the phone was delivered to his home few days ago and have not heard anything yet am going to contact them next am very disappointed that this is seller of amazon and he can get away with selling stolen phones 
831,Apple iPhone 4s,0,i received the phone and when version went to activate they could not they figured an old balance was still on the account
832,Apple iPhone 4s,0,although purchased through company that stated that they ensure the phone worked there was still number attached to it and therefore could not be activated had to return the phone still waiting on credit but it has only been little more than week 
833,Apple iPhone 4s,1,i have had this phone for 6 months now and it is still great considering an upgrade to the 6 but am only holding off because love this one so much 
834,Apple iPhone 4s,1,quality product seemed new in every way would not hesitate to be repeat customer
835,Apple iPhone 4s,0,box id numbers belonged to phone owned active under another persons account plus somebody personal info was not cleared or phone not reset verizon customer service helped find the true id in the phone itself got it activated 
836,Apple iPhone 4s,1,i love it 
837,Apple iPhone 4s,0,do not do buy this company is operated by thieves like many others the phone received did not meet the description it was not verizon phone nor was it unlocked it was sprint locked phone with previous users data spend few more dollars and get something that works stay far away learn from my mistake

887,Apple iPhone 4s,1,i love my iphone would recommend it to anyone my only complaint is that siri is not very intuitive and can be difficult or sometimes impossible to work correctly 
888,Apple iPhone 4s,1,i purchased this and got it within week the cord was not working sent note via amazon to the buyer he responded in 5 minutes and he replaced the cord with new one within week am loving this device though refurbished couldn tell if this was new or refurbished iphones are the best and stream to your other apple products with ease 
889,Apple iPhone 4s,1,worked really hard to find price that would fit my budget and found this 16gb which has enough space for my day to day activities would buy second one if could 
890,Apple iPhone 4s,0,the phone was supposed to be new but it clearly wasn the battery is shot and drains itself completely in about an hour and when plugged it into the computer there was already someone name associated with it 
891,Apple iPhone 4s,1,i was anti iphone but do like it there few things that had on my android that cant get on this but ill learn to live with it
892,Apple iPhone 4s,0,it a phone the battery is poor and only lasts about 24 hours with low level usage the screen is unresponsive in the lower left hand corner when the phone is held vertical the charging cord that came with it doesn work at all have to use the cord from my ipad to charge it screen changes occur without input from me making usage awkward at times it must have been an imperfect phone 
893,Apple iPhone 4s,0,bought 2 as new however 1 battery barely holds charge leading me to believe it may have been refurbished or used 
894,Apple iPhone 4s,0,battery was shot
895,Apple iPhone 4s,0,not verizon phone looks good but can not use because it not verizon phone very disappointed
896,Apple iPhone 4s,0,as it says verizon 4s just went to verizon wireless to get my number transferred over turns out cant because it says in the general info that it is sprint phone so much for my excitement when saw the package on my door step 
897,Apple iPhone 4s,1,wife loves it thanks
898,Apple iPhone 4s,0,this is brocken refurbished product is dead want my money back
899,Apple iPhone 4s,0,well ordered an iphone 4s but got plain iphone 4 they look similar but now can update to ios 9 stuck with ios 7 double checked and sure enough ordered 4s the delivery box said 4s but the reseller packaged iphone 4 
900,Apple iPhone 4s,0,my microphone had water damage
901,Apple iPhone 4s,1,good
902,Apple iPhone 4s,1,still works great 
903,Apple iPhone 4s,1,i bought replacement phone for my fiancee because her phone was pretty much worthless and knew she liked iphones so got the 4s for replacement until our next upgrade am really glad purchased it off of amazon they sent the phone really fast and it was as described almost thought the phone was brand new because it was in that good of shape activating it was easy and now she is good to go with her new phone the 4s is decent phone but the whole buying used cell phone on amazon was very smooth and painless process would do again if needed 
904,Apple iPhone 4s,0,phone was supposed to be new battery will only charge if phone is completely powered off and then it takes about 8 hours or more to charge to 75 or so clearly not functional for many people to have to leave their phone off 1 3 of the day don know how long time it might be before before plug it in to find it won charge at all would not be so angry if it had not been presented as brand new could have taken my chances and bought used or refurbished one for much lower price that might have actually worked properly also angry about the amount of time am going to have to spend trying to deal with this issue again as like most people need working phone and this one is obviously defective it appears from the reviews am not the only one who has been cheated by this particular seller pretty pathetic way to make money would say 
905,Apple iPhone 4s,0,bad from the start arrived late and when it did it literally was crusted with some unknown substance there were also scratches and strange brown spots at the edge of the case not as advertised emailed them about it and they basically called me liar sold the phone to person in my office at 50 dollar loss just not have to deal with this company again he is cleaning the scum off it as write this disgusting 
906,Apple iPhone 4s,0,wifi is bad wifi grayed out can not use this feature phone was very disappointed with the 4s how can do it
907,Apple iPhone 4s,0,purchased this phone on july 19th 2013 it was listed as in new condition the phone occasionally failed to switch on but was able to get it to activate by holding down both buttons for 15 seconds or so finally on or about january 25th 2014 it failed to switch on and could not get it to activate took it to verizon where had previously taken it when it would not activate and they too could not get it to open was advised by you that the phone was out of warranty took it to the apples store 180 mile round trip from my home where they quickly brought it back by removing the battery and then replacing the same battery basically re booting the apple technician was able to tell me that the phone was originally purchased from apple in mid 2012 at store in las vegas and that it showed signs of having been refurbished given that supposition would find it very hard to rate this provider other than one star am very disappointed 
908,Apple iPhone 4s,0,phone was broken home button did not work volume and speaker didn work the phone was randomly freeze it was con
909,Apple iPhone 4s,1,the giftee love this phone more than her friends 5s she had no problem getting this phone activated with verizon once she took it to corporate store activation could not be done online and the one verizon reseller she went to wouldn touch it 
910,Apple iPhone 4s,0,when received the phone found that the top button did not click and now have to use the accessibility feature to turn it off also the battery life even when all apps are closed and screen is shut off is horrible 
911,Apple iPhone 4s,1,ordered from mango wireless in like new condition phones came as described new and in original boxes only issue was they put t mobile sim card in one of the phones ordered which are verizon simple fix just had to remove the card contacted the seller but still no response however am very pleased with my order and haven had any other problems since 
912,Apple iPhone 4s,1,great phone exactly what was looking for seller was spot on on what phone offered more of beginner iphone but as an experienced user like the simple ness 
913,Apple iPhone 4s,0,the phone arrived faster than the estimated delivery date great man lol the phone was wrapped with paper towel that was funny guess the person couldnt afford bubble wrap or whatever smh had to clean the iphone was dirty as hell not great other than that the phone works fine for now battery dies fast to me though 
914,Apple iPhone 4s,1,we bought this phone to replace 4s that we had that cracked was hesitant to purchase cell phone through amazon but turned out fine works as well as the one we pd over 300 for 2 yrs ago the phone looked new no scratches no damage of any type the only bad thing was the wall charger had cut in the cord it looked like knife or box cutter type cut down to the actual wire but not through the wires it didn effect the use of the charger it still worked fine but just for safety reasons we just tossed it back in the box and are using our previous charger so this wasn a big deal to us because we had an additional charger but know this would be irritating to many but m giving this 4 stars because the phone itself was like new quality and shipped really quick packaging was also very good it came in 4s new looking box with the ear buds and charger overall happy with purchase 
915,Apple iPhone 4s,1,great
916,Apple iPhone 4s,1,i got this to work with tracfone exactly as described and arrived very quickly love it

920,Apple iPhone 4s,0,i took this phone to two different verizon stores and they were unable to activate it am very grateful for amazon return policy when took action to return it shipping label e free return shipping was provided to me and once the phone was returned received refund for the cost of the phone as well as the shipping costs because was still phone less when this phone would not activate went to phone repair shop and picked up similar phone for similar price if you have lost or broken your phone and need replacement recommend you check out the local phone repair shops first they may have temporary solution until you are eligible for an upgrade

1011,Apple iPhone 4s,1,phone works great and just as promised on the discription the only problem was paid extra for 2 day shipping and it actually took week but other then the wait everything came as expected
1012,Apple iPhone 4s,0,the owner did not think it was relevant to make it clear that the iphone he she was selling was in fact broken and the screen would not even turn on even took the phone to best buy and had them examine it and was told that it was beyond repair therefore paid 250 00 for an irriparable iphone contacted the seller to see if could get my money back and was told that he she did not provide refunds but offered to sell me screen for the broken iphone that purchased this would not have fixed the iphone and the owner was just trying to scam me further am obviously not happy with my purchase and would advise anyone else against purchasing from this seller he she is scam artist and fooled me 
1013,Apple iPhone 4s,0,phone use is no problem but the appearance of deep scratches and described as new businesses do not match is in use quite satisfactory 
1014,Apple iPhone 4s,0,although the description doesn say it a new phone it doesn say it a used one either the one got had all kinds of information from the previous owner don have problem buying refurb but d like to pay the price of one not slightly lower price than brand new one so beware you may be looking to buy used phone

1029,Apple iPhone 4s,1,beautiful item 
1030,Apple iPhone 4s,1,good 
1031,Apple iPhone 4s,0,the only reason gave it 1 star is because technically got phone and it works but this was advertised as new sealed phone about 2 months after got it the battery started draining really fast am familiar with best practices to extend battery life etc so this indicated that the phone was not in fact new at least the battery wasn some time later opened up the included earbuds and plugged them in only to find out that they are really awful the sound is bad and it goes in and out if you barely touch the cord the sound glitches indicating that internal wires may be loose but they were new remember upon further examination m pretty sure that they are knock off buds not true apple buds if had purchased phone that was honestly advertised as used refurbished wouldn have been as upset by these things but to buy new phone only to be searching within months for replacement battery and spending additional money on new pair of ear buds is very frustrating false advertising to say the least feels like was lied to 
1032,Apple iPhone 4s,1,wonderful this was brand new phone seals in its original box 
1033,Apple iPhone 4s,0,about 2 weeks after receiving this phone it stopped working wouldn shut off froze wouldn take pictures am extremely unhappy with this product when asked for refund within the 30 day guarantee never got response 
1034,Apple iPhone 4s,1,phone came as described have faith that amazon always provides quality products phone came with new ear buds and charging cables brick phone was near flawless and made 12 yo very happy camper on his birthday 
1035,Apple iPhone 4s,1,perfect 
1036,Apple iPhone 4s,1,i got great price on this iphone which was in very good shape
1037,Apple iPhone 4s,0,this product is broken iphone won charge 
1038,Apple iPhone 4s,0,i bought this phone to replace google galazy nexus while this phone runs great most of the time the phone will turn off with almost 30 left of battery life sometimes more do really like this phone but honestly when you re in time crunch and need something like directions or to get hold of someone having your phone turn off unexpectedly isn awesome 
1039,Apple iPhone 4s,0,clearly marked as verizon phone but it is not 
1040,Apple iPhone 4s,0, bought two of these phones which clearly states verizon received them and it is for virgin mobile reading through the other reviews it looks like there are about 5 of us in recent days not only will be returning it m letting amazon know how wrong and misleading your advertising 
1041,Apple iPhone 4s,1,meets all standards 
1042,Apple iPhone 4s,1,great phone great deal
1043,Apple iPhone 4s,0,i got broken one the lock button did not work and week later it couldn take charge 
1044,Apple iPhone 4s,1,this was gift for my son and he loves it he said he was surprised what great shape it was in the shipping materials could have been better but the phone came through in just the padded envelope without scratch 
1045,Apple iPhone 4s,1,this iphone was exactly as depicted at first was skeptical buying an iphone off amazon but it worked and at great price when went to charge the iphone it didn turn on so contacted the seller and they agreed to take it back luckily tried different charging cable the one they provided didn work the phone works great
1046,Apple iPhone 4s,1,fantastic phone perfect size fits in pocket like the location of charging port easy to navigate and don need fingerprint to log on wish phone 5 was built like this

1048,Apple iPhone 4s,1,exactly what they promised excellent condition came with the charger and was completely ready for activation recommend especially at this price 
1049,Apple iPhone 4s,0,there wasn anything in the description that saw that said the power button was sticking so had to spend another 65 dollars to get it fixed had known that before bought it wouldn have bought it 
1050,Apple iPhone 4s,0,a month ago bought them to you cell phone but requested new iphone and you sent me used iphone it seems to me that you are swindlers need you to solve the situation and send me back to my new phone 
1051,Apple iPhone 4s,1,the phone is in like new condition and it was exactly as it was described am extremely happy with this purchase 
1052,Apple iPhone 4s,0,although this verizon iphone 4s is in great shape for used one have not been able to use its international gsm capabilities abroad because has been blocked by verizon with the complicity of apple the later does not unblock the iphone without previous approval from verizon and verizon does not unblock the international gsm capabilities of this units unless the owner me or anyone is verizon customer in good standing for at least two months sound like monopoly seems unfair sure it is call verizon global services and they told me that story and said that should try that amazon warehouse the seller unblock it on my behalf tried to make it work with kolbi 3 5g costa rican network using its sim card buy the cellphone keep on asking verizon unlocking code 
1053,Apple iPhone 4s,1,love it
1054,Apple iPhone 4s,0,there is an issue with the wifi chip not working which is common with lot of 4s unfortunately there is no way of fixing it so you going to end up with phone that will only be able to use data 
1055,Apple iPhone 4s,1,came in very little scrathes looks almost brand new it did need the docking station cleaned out other than that no problems great phone 
1056,Apple iPhone 4s,1,terrific the only drawback being that the battery loses charge very quickly however for the price it a minor inconvenience 
1057,Apple iPhone 4s,1,apple iphone 4s 16gb black verizon recieved my iphone on time and it looked like it was brand new the phone was still in the original box factory sealed but the battery life sucks it won hardly hold charge at all other then that it is exactly what expected 
1058,Apple iPhone 4s,0,i thought was getting new phone the condition stated new received the phone and the charger did not work called apple to warranty the charger was told that it wasn new phone and had been repaired few times ended up buying new charger elsewhere kept the phone because my other phone is completely dead really don mind having refurb but m upset that paid for new phone

1062,Apple iPhone 4s,0,the apple iphone4s is shutting off continuously m not happy with this phone the battery percentage seems to be off
1063,Apple iPhone 4s,1,love this phone very easy to work with would highly recommend having the 16g allows more storage on phone for any downloads
1064,Apple iPhone 4s,1,shipped on time in great condition note that with verizon you cannot change carriers after you activate it so if you weren planning on going with verizon choose different phone with the carrier you want to stick with otherwise great option if your looking into iphones 
1065,Apple iPhone 4s,1,initially had reservations about buying refurbished iphone especially online when you cant see your purchase beforehand however the price difference between device from the verizon store about 200 dollars is hard to deny happybook1 put me at ease with her prompt email responses and patience handling my questions contacted her during the weekend expecting hours or even days before reply but she emailed back within 20 minutes when you buy from her store you ll get almost an immediate email detailing your purchase and its tracking code as well as an entreaty to take up any complaints or issues with her which she will resolve to the best of her ability placed my order for an iphone 4s locked to verizon on saturday and received it wednesday two days before the earliest delivery estimate secured in bubble wrapped envelope that was placed inside tightly taped priority cardboard box the phone was in better condition than described looking brand new to all except the most discerning eye it also came with new apple earbuds usb connector and front and back screen protectorswhen buying an iphone or any other smartphone online one runs the risk of getting stolen item or encountering other ploys by unscrupulous sellers highly recommend happybook1 and am very satisfied with this transaction

1127,Apple iPhone 4s,0,broke down and had battery problems would not reccomend this vendor

1129,Apple iPhone 4s,1,item returned but as described
1130,Apple iPhone 4s,1,nice
1131,Apple iPhone 4s,1,great buy great product
1132,Apple iPhone 4s,1,perfect condition just as described by the seller works great at fair price 
1133,Apple iPhone 4s,0,bad from the start arrived late and when it did it literally was crusted with some unknown substance there were also scratches and strange brown spots at the edge of the case not as advertised emailed them about it and they basically called me liar sold the phone to person in my office at 50 dollar loss just not have to deal with this company again he is cleaning the scum off it as write this disgusting 
1134,Apple iPhone 4s,0,wifi is bad wifi grayed out can not use this feature phone was very disappointed with the 4s how can do it
1135,Apple iPhone 4s,0,purchased this phone on july 19th 2013 it was listed as in new condition the phone occasionally failed to switch on but was able to get it to activate by holding down both buttons for 15 seconds or so finally on or about january 25th 2014 it failed to switch on and could not get it to activate took it to verizon where had previously taken it when it would not activate and they too could not get it to open was advised by you that the phone was out of warranty took it to the apples store 180 mile round trip from my home where they quickly brought it back by removing the battery and then replacing the same battery basically re booting the apple technician was able to tell me that the phone was originally purchased from apple in mid 2012 at store in las vegas and that it showed signs of having been refurbished given that supposition would find it very hard to rate this provider other than one star am very disappointed 
1136,Apple iPhone 4s,0,phone was broken home button did not work volume and speaker didn work the phone was randomly freeze it was con
1137,Apple iPhone 4s,1,the giftee love this phone more than her friends 5s she had no problem getting this phone activated with verizon once she took it to corporate store activation could not be done online and the one verizon reseller she went to wouldn touch it 
1138,Apple iPhone 4s,0,when received the phone found that the top button did not click and now have to use the accessibility feature to turn it off also the battery life even when all apps are closed and screen is shut off is horrible 
1139,Apple iPhone 4s,1,ordered from mango wireless in like new condition phones came as described new and in original boxes only issue was they put t mobile sim card in one of the phones ordered which are verizon simple fix just had to remove the card contacted the seller but still no response however am very pleased with my order and haven had any other problems since 
1140,Apple iPhone 4s,1,great phone exactly what was looking for seller was spot on on what phone offered more of beginner iphone but as an experienced user like the simple ness 
1141,Apple iPhone 4s,1,the 4s is great phone never realized how great until it was trade in time and got droid phone sure my iphone is only 3g but don use the hotspot feature that much to really care as an internet client browser it is excellent in terms of functionality well all of it apps work can say the same thing for my android phone sure have mac mini at home and everything integrates well which is how it should all work actually do some mac programming and m long time unix lover so the mac is perfect for me my phone which runs the latest and greatest os does so and will continue to because apple doesn fragment their ios distro unlike other companies there is basically one platform which makes life simple for developers enough of this stuffthe bottom line is that it works from siri to browsing texting and integrating with my desktop when it finally dies ll get new iphone foxcomm might suck as company but they make some great products 
1142,Apple iPhone 4s,1,looked brand new even though it used works great love the design and the iphone is the best phone
1143,Apple iPhone 4s,1,i needed replacement phone as ruined my iphone 5 last october the phone arrived in timely fashion great appearance but better yet it has been working flawlessly plan to get one for my husband 
1144,Apple iPhone 4s,1,i was skeptical about buying phone online but did lot of research and was careful to pick reputable seller also checked that the imei had been cleared and that the phone was set up for my carrier received the phone promptly and had no problem setting up the service the phone is just like brand new but paid about half the price love it 
1145,Apple iPhone 4s,1,highly recommended from here came good as new and no problems works perfectly fine and couldn enjoy it anymore than do 
1146,Apple iPhone 4s,1,they did such an incredible time the phone got here before it was scheduled and is in tip top shape runs perfect and they are very efficient highly recommended 
1147,Apple iPhone 4s,1,going from an android to and iphone there much of difference like the iphone more the only reason am not giving it 5 stars is because the screen cracks quickly ve had the phone for 2 months and my screen is already cracked 
1148,Apple iPhone 4s,0,we ll the company that shipped the phone either messed up with fedex or fedex messed up either way didn get the phone when was supposed to but that isn what bothered me per se what bothered me is when was activating the supposed new phone found out through verizon that the phone had two previous owners contacted the company that is the go between with amazon and they blew me off in the end they just beat me through attrition 
1149,Apple iPhone 4s,0,you bought phone that was supposed to be new and was refurbished you send it me on napkin whitout charger or accesories and when return it rather than returning me 300 dollars that pay for it you only give me 200 dollar abusive get unable to retur 80 percent at least 
1150,Apple iPhone 4s,0,i got the phone from reputable seller the phone was shipped within couple hours of purchase it arrived to my office within 72 hours the phone looked like 8 10 with the described surface damage it looked great however on the first attempt at an incoming call it is sent directly to voicemail and it never rings on my end only when the outside caller attempts to redial does the phone ring so the result was ton of missed calls for my business which cannot afford 
1151,Apple iPhone 4s,1,with the holidays and such the item was slow in getting to me but once it came it lived up to my expectations 
1152,Apple iPhone 4s,0,not only was this not an iphone 4s it was an iphone 4 when we decided to keep it anyway and activate it verizon refused to activate it as it was listed as lost or stolen phone this was christmas gift and pretty much ruined christmas for us we returned it and received refund used amazon instead of buying locally to avoid this type of situation was told would be given an amazon credit for all of my trouble and have yet to see that 
1153,Apple iPhone 4s,0,ok
1154,Apple iPhone 4s,0,just so so what bought is an used like new iphone 4s on the warehouse deals the condition of the item is just so so not very good or bad but used it well it has not any problems

1160,Apple iPhone 4s,1,came just as listed no scratches and in perfect condition honestly the best you can ask for at such low price 
1161,Apple iPhone 4s,0,the phone is received was more than excessively scratched up it took verizon 2 hours to activate it and it overheating as we speak in my hand ve literally had it activated for all of 5 hours fully charged it and it battery is already dead the description is nothing like what received this morning m beyond pissed 
1162,Apple iPhone 4s,0,these phone keeps on turning it self off and the battery life last on like 3 hours or less so if there is any one who knows what up let me know it it a hassle to return it 
1163,Apple iPhone 4s,0,wifi didn work on this phone it wasn from lack of trying liked other features of this phone and that why gave it 3 
1164,Apple iPhone 4s,0,i will never shop at amazon again to this date still cannot use the phone purchased because there was no user name and pass word to unlocked the device and to make things worst the website that was provided to unlocked the phone was not able to do so
1165,Apple iPhone 4s,1,nice phone for good price if you need new phone and it not time for an upgrade under your contract this is the way to go 
1166,Apple iPhone 4s,1,as expected rode in white horse drawn chariot along side me was elppa the road littered with decomposing
1167,Apple iPhone 4s,1,it is good no problems so far it isnt slow and got it set up nice and easily good stuff
1168,Apple iPhone 4s,1,i found this phone to be good purchase it arrived on time and as it was described have yet to find any fault with it 
1169,Apple iPhone 4s,1,i was very unsure about purchasing this phone at first especially due to some of the reviews but them being old reviews just took the risk and purchased it anyways received it today and so far everything seems to be working just fine already comes with ios7 installed and original charger and cable come with it as well phone is used it has normal wear on the silver edges but nothing to the point of complaining also got it activated without problem

1175,Apple iPhone 4s,1,everything works but the battery is basically shot would have liked to know this in the description 
1176,Apple iPhone 4s,1,everything went great
1177,Apple iPhone 4s,1,was in excellent condition and worked as advertised 
1178,Apple iPhone 4s,0,the first phone received was turned in gov phone with bad battery the second phone was an t phone sent them both back and went back to my ravine flip phone that always works so much for upgrades 
1179,Apple iPhone 4s,0,the phone required 75 repair less than week after received it 
1180,Apple iPhone 4s,1,love it 
1181,Apple iPhone 4s,0,ugh had terrible issues with mail delivery delays and then when it arrived it had not been reset and was unusable how can that even happen 
1182,Apple iPhone 4s,1,very happy quick delivery and everything perfect thanks
1183,Apple iPhone 4s,1,great experience from beginning to end someone stole my first phone and ordered from another company at first and did not get what wanted was little hesitant at first but it turned out to be the best decision great customer service affordable price was able to use my amex points as well timely delivery and new out of the box condition phone what peace of mind 
1184,Apple iPhone 4s,1,i bought this phone for my daughter 15th birthday she loves it it arrived in pristine condition we easily activated it at our local verizon store and it has been working perfectly ever since the seller provided great follow up to our order would absolutely purchase from this seller again 
1185,Apple iPhone 4s,0,this is defective phone advertised under the precept of it being used very good condition advertised as slight water damage causing screen to have minor discoloration on top and bottom no crack screen which we discovered meant in reality that it was severely water damaged the camera didn work very good condition not it had replacement screen that was not properly connected to give complete visibility no crack screen of course not it was replaced the screen continuously jumped up and down and evenly went black which m not sure if that is better or worse than the minor discoloration on top and bottom of screen all within 3 hours of activating the phone this phone was in anything but good condition and dishonest semantics justified dishonest behavior and that is bad business dealing for such what thought was trustworthy site as amazon 
1186,Apple iPhone 4s,1,phone came in box with accessories and works great was pleasantly surprised was just like new would recommend
1187,Apple iPhone 4s,1,the truth is they are both fabulous pieces of equipment that we are all very lucky to have in our lives actually remember having 4 digit phone number and 5 people sharing the same line but for reasons subtle which am not even totally conscious of love my iphone and didn love my android 
1188,Apple iPhone 4s,0,i recently bought an iphone 4s from this seller when it arrived it looked fine we went to verizon to set it up and here is where the problem started the camera light would not turn off the tech said that a sign of water damage and it was literally draining the battery at very rapid rate booked genius bar appointment at apple to see if it could be fixed when they opened up the phone they discovered it has been tampered with voiding the warranty and the light was not repairable contacted the seller who sent us another iphone 4s potential buyers read this given our issue with the last phone we booked another apple store appointment just to have the phone checked out it even worse this time around the apple tech said it had been tampered with and cautioned us to get rid of the phone as soon as possible when pushed him for details on what was wrong with the phone he said the phone had been tampered with to the point that it can be used for identity theft basically opening any accounts used on the phone and getting account information he wasn supposed to tell us this but thank god he did almost everyone know has banking app or email with very private information no matter how much it ends up costing you do not buy from this seller m fairly certain all of the positive reviews are from people who are none the wiser and never had their phones inspected by an apple tech remember that it takes over year to get your identity back if its stolen not worth it for used iphone 
1189,Apple iPhone 4s,0,the product was not required because m blocked with the telephony company verizon try to unlock it but it is very expensive and keep him now the battery does not work and not to do lost my money please tell me that can do if can still return it thanks

1192,Apple iPhone 4s,1,1st phone would completely discharge after 2 5 hrs automatically mute itself so you couldn hear it ring voice quality was fuzzy seller was not easy to deal with and after shipping the phone back to him he denied there was anything wrong with it and was going to charge 6 restocking fee after finally convincing him of the issues he did send working quality phone 
1193,Apple iPhone 4s,1,i had droid phone and had lots of problems verizon swapped it out 3 times and the problems never ceased got this phone and love it no problems no glitches and have signal love it 
1194,Apple iPhone 4s,1,apple makes great phone there is no doubt bought this for my daughter it works flawlessly and smoothly the big problem with apple products are they are proprietary locked down even charger costs 20 00 and the number of free apps is much smaller than android products

1197,Apple iPhone 4s,0,when tried to activate the phone was told the phone had been reported lost or stolen so obviously could not be used the only positive thing can say is that the seller did refund the purchase with minimal hassle 
1198,Apple iPhone 4s,1,the battery can be used only half an day when listen music or watch movie or play games if in the standy model it can be used for one day 
1199,Apple iPhone 4s,1,arrived in excellent condition functions flawlessly and worked right out of the box for my mother christmas gift worth it

1205,Apple iPhone 4s,1,the purchase and product was very good choice everything went very well purchase shipping and product is what you would want
1206,Apple iPhone 4s,1,this phone was in great condition as advertised ready for and easy to switch account info over to this phone
1207,Apple iPhone 4s,0,the bottom line is that disliked this phone so much that returned it know you re not supposed to say that about apple products but read on to see why think people are largely drinking the koolaid on the iphone the bad when first wanted smartphone got very cheap droid which was hard to sync between the mac home computer use and my google email accounts eventually got it working but anticipated that the almighty iphone would be seamless right out of the box it wasn with the iphone had all the same troubles going back to the google accounts that had had with the droid going to the apple products the first time around not fun also didn like that there is no app available to back sms text messages up to your gmail or other email account the way there is for android phones sms backup in the event of phone change and god forbid you do not want another iproduct you will lose all of those conversations couldn organize the screens the way wanted them missed having my contacts pictures show up next to text messages and in my phone address book it the little things but still the back menus will probably frustrate former droid users as sometimes you have to use the actual butto at the bottom of the phone to go back to the home screen but sometimes you want the real back button on the screen which is usually but not always located at the top this is counterintuitive and annoying the good the camera worked well the screen was beautiful and the sound was good size is great compared to the other expensive android models which are bit like holding an entire computer up to your head also there are no rights issues with older itunes purchases which have yet to resolve on my new android the verdict overall was disappointed in the operating system think largely because the iphone is supposed to be the gold standard among smartphones and had heard wonderful glowing things from so many people who loooove their iphones however naysayers come out of the woodwork once they realize that they will have sympathetic ear in someone who isn subscribing blindly to the iuniverse and there are fair number of people who prefer the droids to me the final factor may be how computer savvy you are going in and how much time you want to put into learning about your phone and all the different service providers and programs that will in theory at least work together to get it to do what you want it to do if you re willing to take the time you might eventually prefer an android if not the iphone is definitely not as simple as thought it would be but would still recommend it for anyone who doesn have the technological know how or desire to play detective in order to get things set up will add that when combined with trying to find the right cellular service provider verizon has nonexistant customer service and everything requires several phone calls as well as hours on hold to get anything done at has less signal strength in my area and couldn get usable data to with mobile through straight talk buying new phone and smartphone in particular has been one of the most frustrating experiences of my life once get my current phone working samsung galaxy s3 plan to keep it forever and to never ever ever make any changes to my system again what an exercise in futility this has been 
1208,Apple iPhone 4s,0,apple is very proprietary if you can deal with the mass limitations even between other apple products it a decent smartphone it is hugely over priced though 
1209,Apple iPhone 4s,1,highly recommend ordered this iphone and it ended up coming right during an address change and he was really easy to work with about the shipping iphone arrived in great condition and works great will definitely be recommending alex to future buyers and will use him anytime m caught between upgrades needing phone thanks for all the hard word
1210,Apple iPhone 4s,0,when received the iphone there was crack on the back of the phone across the camera eye it was mentioned in the description before purchased the phone it had no scratches or cracks that statement is misleading would not use the vendor again thank you pw
1211,Apple iPhone 4s,1,very helpful when had the issue and then phone started working on its own when originally contacted them was not happy with the response but as soon as wrote the review they were more than happy to help me with my issue and it was corrected quickly 
1212,Apple iPhone 4s,1,the phone is in like new condition has small scratch on the screen that barely noticeable but other than that the phone has been very good to me 
1213,Apple iPhone 4s,1,you can get one lot cheaper but it came in really great condition just one speck on the screen with the led but love it 
1214,Apple iPhone 4s,0,its pretty nice phone but in my case couldn stand it bought this iphone to be backup if you will have the galaxy 3 and switching to the iphone which isn even 4g is major downgrade 
1215,Apple iPhone 4s,0,phone use is no problem condition said like new but m not satisfied with it hope it is real like new 
1216,Apple iPhone 4s,0,i sent msg to the place that purchased the iphone saying that the phone is an iphone 4 and not an iphone 4s as puchased for didnt get any answer from it am really upset about it want my money of the difference back am from argentina and cant exchange the phone but want the money of the difference in my credit card back 
1217,Apple iPhone 4s,1,perfect screen and back cover some lightly scratch on metal frame the net is locked by verizon must spend about 80 to unlock it 
1218,Apple iPhone 4s,0,i liked the iphone but after one month found that its one speaker is not working was thinking that everything would be fine because when was shopping on amazon there was written that we have tested this item and every thing is working fine there was scratch on the body also 
1219,Apple iPhone 4s,1,the phone is easy to use and the iphone can be hard to handle you need to add your own contacts and setup the verizon information when you activate the phone itself verizon was helpful to help setup the phone and walks you through the steps to get the iphone going this iphone is big upgrade from iphone 4 and the next one to get if you want is iphone 5c but if you want to use your finger print then get iphone 5s instead the iphone 4s has many neat features from the boarding pass the compass good handy world clock and compass to track your journey and use itunes and other neat stuff be sure to get verizon based phone its well worth it 
1220,Apple iPhone 4s,1,i am in love with this iphone cannot get enough of it already got it connected loveeee
1221,Apple iPhone 4s,0,the iphone cycled upon purchase so upgraded to the latest ios after that the wifi was grayed out so we couldn actually turn it on or off turns out tons of people have this problem returned it 
1222,Apple iPhone 4s,1,i bought it for my son he and were both impressed with the condition and quality of this item very satisfied two thumbs up
1223,Apple iPhone 4s,1,second iphone ve ordered from planet mobile both were gifts for others and they both loved their phones no issues activating shipped and received pretty quickly less than 5 business days in each case 
1224,Apple iPhone 4s,1,i bought this iphone 4s from the amazon warehouse because of the great return policy wasn sure what would receive the condition was described as used like new which was little too positive front and back sides were flawless the metallic ring antenna had dirt and residue which could not remove so far the battery seems to be the original one which already shows signs of wear might need to replace with new one soon first thing checked if the esn imei was clean which it was it could even be activated with tracfone in the byop program overall am happy with the purchase although some other buyers reported that amazon warehouse used like new meant really new but that would not have worked with tracfone since they require previously verizon activated device in order to activate with their bring your own phone program modified from their page plus acquisition 
1225,Apple iPhone 4s,0,phone is not unlocked as sold unfortunately as left for the uk shortly after buying it have misssed my return window next time ll set fire to 200 instead buyer beware 
1226,Apple iPhone 4s,1,phone came in excellent condition shipping was quicker than posted got this phone for my son who broke his old one as of now he seems pleased with his replacement also came with the usb cable 
1227,Apple iPhone 4s,0,phone looked great when it arrived but when we went to activate it at the verizon store they said it couldn connect to anything cellular completely defective need to return now

1245,Apple iPhone 4s,1,perfect condition came in different phone box but that didn matter to me was able to bring to verizon and get info transferred without hitch and was able to skip the added on monthly fees if would have bought the same phone from verizon saving us hundreds of dollars each year for the next two years

1431,Apple iPhone 4s,1,bought this phone mainly just to take with me to college and not be afraid that someone would steal it because who would want to steal 4s but anyway my seller said top button was glitchy expected it to work but with little difficulty the only way to use the top button is to press it on hard surface like wall for now m using the accessibility mode to turn the screen off also the phone was really grimy when received it dust in the speaker and microphone and the charger port it could have easily been cleaned before shipped attempted to update to ios 8 2 and thought broke it the phone it was stuck on connect to itunes screen but reinstalled itunes on my computer and set the phone to recovery mode tried to download 8 2 again and it worked overall satisfied with my purchase

1802,Apple iPhone 4s,1,okay but looks some costly
1803,Apple iPhone 4s,1,extremely pleased
1804,Apple iPhone 4s,1,i recently purchased this phone as birthday present for my son had this phone back when it was first released by apple and had no issues with it this phone was refurbished and came in looking brand new the only difference was the fact that it came in plain box and with no headphone it did include the charger and cable however he has been using the phone now for few weeks and it has worked flawlessly if you are looking to buy phone outright would definitely opt for refurbished model buy many items that have been on the market for while refurbished and have never had any problems with operation or aesthetics of them 
1805,Apple iPhone 4s,0,phones appear to be in good condition not sure about them being new and the after market accessories are very cheap the usb cable came apart while charging the first time reported to customer service via email but have yet to hear back so just went to find my own replacement hopefully the phones hold up longer than the charger 
1806,Apple iPhone 4s,1,its good exactly what is pictured
1807,Apple iPhone 4s,1,everything was fine 
1808,Apple iPhone 4s,0,not buying it does not work does not play audio from videos or ring when they call no charge and am now in colombia and can not return it and amazon is not responding

1827,Apple iPhone 4s,1,it was in great condition and received it just as they stated
1828,Apple iPhone 4s,0,i ve got to be honest was little leary about this product ordered it then looked at the reviews boy were they unappealing to read was super nervous about what had just ordered but to my surprise it was just fine yes the phone is unlocked but the box it came in said it would not work for any sprint or sprint affiliated carrier so that was confusing the battery is just as everybody says discharges super fast and turns off when its around 20 phone looked brand new no scratches powered right up and put my sim card in service kicked right in overall not bad 
1829,Apple iPhone 4s,0,we receive without all the accessories and the charge doesn complete you are selling bad product

1838,Apple iPhone 4s,0,i bought the phone knowing that it was refurbished did not look new the glass was possibly replaced but the sides of the phone were worn possibly from case it was in the phone worked for about three weeks before it crashed would not charge and would not turn on took it to apple and they told me that the battery only lasts 3000 cycles and that it had not been replaced on the phone it would cost 80 to replace it this phone is junk and was not correctly refurbished save your self the trouble had and do not buy it 
1839,Apple iPhone 4s,1,it ok
1840,Apple iPhone 4s,0,the phone was in perfect shape as far as the appearance once got it activated had to update the ios to be able to use itunes and the apple store the phone worked fast until started taking pictures and downloaded few apps it uses more data than any other phone ve ever used it usually takes me month and half to run out of 2gb of data but with this phone it took two weeks have even turned off lot of applications from running in the background the absolute worst thing about it is that the battery life with minimum usage typically last me 2 hours god forbid make one five minute phone call it drains the battery down completely within five minutes usually have to use it plugged into the charger it has features that love but really don believe will keep this phone just because of the consistent low storage warning low battery life and slow system wanted to return it but didn know how

2058,Apple iPhone 4s,0,it was ok when first purchased it but after few months it started to freeze lot of times 
2059,Apple iPhone 4s,0,i bought 5 unlocked phones it turns out only 4 phones were unlocked 
2060,Apple iPhone 4s,0,screen is got some problems but other than that it fine 
2061,Apple iPhone 4s,1,looks nice nw m using its works good too
2062,Apple iPhone 4s,0,no did not meet my expectations very poor 
2063,Apple iPhone 4s,0,i was very disappointed its advertised as certified refurbished but right out of the box the wifi did not work on the phone nor did the bluetooth looked up reasons why and found that the wifi antenna is broken everything else works fine on it but after not having the availability to use the internet indoors in most cases and not being able listen to my music m already looking to buy new phone 
2064,Apple iPhone 4s,0,is not gsm
2065,Apple iPhone 4s,0,i set the phone up with at and the first call made found that cannot hear the call the earphone portion is defective after all that trouble now have to return the phone for credit 
2066,Apple iPhone 4s,1,the item is very nice
2067,Apple iPhone 4s,1,everything works well phone looks almost brand new however recieved the wrong charger port 
2068,Apple iPhone 4s,1,so far so good
2069,Apple iPhone 4s,0,i really not happy with the quality of these phones have ordered two used and factory refurbished one had an amazingly horrible battery charged it to 100 set it up and it was almost dead and would die as soon as it hit five percent so ordered this one it arrived with its test pictures still on it the background was not reset to factory settings and to make matters worse it won connect to the internet my phone got stolen out of my car iphones are crazy expensive and thought factory refurbished from amazon would be the cheaper way to go definitely not think twice before ordering these phones 
2070,Apple iPhone 4s,1,the phone has small scratch on the screen upon delivery it isn terrible and it is refurbished phone worked great out of the box satisfied with the purchase overall 
2071,Apple iPhone 4s,1,great product
2072,Apple iPhone 4s,0,product of poor quality bought and brought me to use outside the usa so it took me time to be able to test the device to my surprise the microphone did not work and all so the battery does not recharge properly as am not in the usa had to arrange myself the repairs to use the device which has cost me about us 60 00 apple iphone 4s 16gb unlocked white certified refurbished 
2073,Apple iPhone 4s,1,i was wrong took this to the apple store because thought it needed new battery they showed me how to put it on airplane mode since am not using it as phone they also helped me set the settings so that it is not on all of the time they did diagnostic test on the battery and showed me the battery was fine it was just my settings that were making the battery run down fast so do not use this as phone but rather as way to have my music my car stereo died while back so listen to this phone in the car and while am on my fast 1 7 mile walk 
2074,Apple iPhone 4s,0,can not download certain app
2075,Apple iPhone 4s,1,this ended up working wonderfully no visible damage and works just like new m impressed 
2076,Apple iPhone 4s,1,it brand new
2077,Apple iPhone 4s,1,great condition great phone normal battery once was shocked by the 1 star reviews finally divided to give it shot m sure that love this one only two cons 1 the os is ios 9 which is very difficult to be downgraded and kind of slow for iphone 4s 2 the battery is not so good will replace the battery with bigger capacity one 
2078,Apple iPhone 4s,1,fine very good
2079,Apple iPhone 4s,1,although am weary of refurbished products figured d give this go because of how cheap it was had bought this for my mother at the beginning of june she has used it ever since with no problems iphone 4s is still great phone today but if you are using it on straight talk plan be aware they will not be able to add the 4g lte plan they begin using 4g with the iphone 5 very satisfied with my purchase 
2080,Apple iPhone 4s,0,yeah so don buy this phone it not unlocked these dudes are either incompetent scamma lamma ding donging us or unable to articulate exactly what they think unlocked means 
2081,Apple iPhone 4s,0,not compatible with the gsm network as promised locked to cdma verizon and sprint network very disappointed perhaps they sent the wrong phone 
2082,Apple iPhone 4s,0,this was gift for my wife and she is happy with it but everything works fine except for wi fi that is greyed out and not usable just google wi fi issues on iphone 4s and you will see what mean you make your own mind on this one

2097,Apple iPhone 4s,0,i was using an iphone 6 but it was lost to the water this looked like good option until the new iphone 7 are released unfortunately the performance difference is significant between this phone and an iphone 6 the battery is really weak and normally requires charging before the day is over the phone is super slow the camera is slow to open apps are terrible not sure if it is the ios 9 on iphone 4 or the phone is bad but this thing is much slower than the iphone 4 had years ago overall the phone is very frustrating to use

2419,Apple iPhone 4s,1,the phone looks great and was well packaged at first was concerned that the phone was not fully unlocked because it was verizon phone but everything works great dont know why some customers had issues with this phone being an old verizon phone unless they just never tried putting sim card in it but im satisfied with everything
2420,Apple iPhone 4s,0,after about three weeks of use noticed the battery running out very quickly now sometimes it goes from 68 to dead instantaneously and sometimes it will stay on 1 for hours know it was refurbished but didn expect the battery to fail that quickly m disappointed to say the least and the phone is no longer eligible for return

2550,Apple iPhone 4s,1,working great well pleased
2551,Apple iPhone 4s,0,got my iphone and the home button was broke
2552,Apple iPhone 4s,0,so far one of the phones has been working good the other one seems to be havingproblems with the wireless adapter since while downloading some apps it got really slow so turned the wireless adapter off in order to reboot it and it never came back on again m actually trying to figure out how to return it none of the phones came with the puncher to be able to insert the sim card no manuals and no headphones

2555,Apple iPhone 4s,0,device did not work to its potential
2556,Apple iPhone 4s,0,wifi and bluetooth is not working
2557,Apple iPhone 4s,1,first let me say m windows insider person m on the fast ring of beta testing my real phone is lumia 950 xl the ones before it were also windows and the ones way before that were android all motorola so this is my first apple phone because 3 4 of my family are apple people we won go into why but blame it on the schools they use facetime lot so hence if want to be part of the social circle have to use apple as for the phone it an okay phone like live tiles better than static apps like the power of windows 10 mobile siri has nothing on cortana microsoft phones are durable and work as well as any with apple reputation so usually only use the iphone on wifi but this certified refurbished phone works and works consistently my one big complaint is it uses micro sim instead of nano sim can swap sims to use cellular service on my main number bought this one for the extraordinary price but see another nano sim model certified refurbished iphone in my future unless of course apple decides to share facetime and itunes with other platforms like microsoft shares office skype wunderlist and many other apps with it competitors btw m what would be considered an elderly woman and not some it professional 
2558,Apple iPhone 4s,0,phone would not hold charge so had to purchase solid battery from reputable seller

2584,Apple iPhone 4s,1,i recently purchased this phone as birthday present for my son had this phone back when it was first released by apple and had no issues with it this phone was refurbished and came in looking brand new the only difference was the fact that it came in plain box and with no headphone it did include the charger and cable however he has been using the phone now for few weeks and it has worked flawlessly if you are looking to buy phone outright would definitely opt for refurbished model buy many items that have been on the market for while refurbished and have never had any problems with operation or aesthetics of them 
2585,Apple iPhone 4s,0,phones appear to be in good condition not sure about them being new and the after market accessories are very cheap the usb cable came apart while charging the first time reported to customer service via email but have yet to hear back so just went to find my own replacement hopefully the phones hold up longer than the charger

2746,Apple iPhone 4s,0,cracked screen
2747,Apple iPhone 4s,1,fantastic phone and got to me earlier than expected 
2748,Apple iPhone 4s,1,after losing my htc one in the sea needed quick replacement and chose the iphone 4s not the latest and greatest but it still good phone with great user interface it does everything need it to do and the speaker is to my ear better than the speakers in the drowned phone ll probably keep it longer than d planed because it has one thing going for it it fits my pocket unlike the htc which is why it at the bottom of the sea ordered this from the used selection to get prime 1 day shipping it arrived in sealed pristine oem packaging and all accessories were likewise sealed in oem packets for some reason m not supposed to mention the warehouse deal got but it was better deal than d hoped for 
2749,Apple iPhone 4s,1,arrived early and in great condition new like the description said love it 
2750,Apple iPhone 4s,0,battery life on my phone is screwed up 
2751,Apple iPhone 4s,1,this iphone is very good your reputation is very good also like very much m going to recommend to you 
2752,Apple iPhone 4s,0,the phone had some clear marks of wearing on the front and back of the phone even thought it was marked as used like new it also was missing the wall plug when it stated that it had all the accesories 
2753,Apple iPhone 4s,0,i haven placed my sim card in the phone yet but think you sold me iphone 4 instead of an iphone 4s looked at the serial number on the back and looked it up and it matches the iphone 4 and also the box didn have the beside the name which also leads me to think that you sent me the wrong thing but get my sim card on tuesday so if set up the phone and it has siri there won be problem 
2754,Apple iPhone 4s,1,the phone is good just that when received it the flashlight wasn working but got partial refund back other than that he phone is hundred percent good 
2755,Apple iPhone 4s,1,the iphone ordered was listed as like new there were no comments to go along with the product when purchased it the iphone is fully functional however it has quite bit of cosmetic wear which to me does not mean it like new but that could be blamed on me for not asking for pictures or any further detail overall fully functioning and very fast shipping 
2756,Apple iPhone 4s,1,perfect thank you for the fast delivery beautiful condition lost my iphone and bought this one felt weird about buying it online but it exceeded expectations thanks 
2757,Apple iPhone 4s,0,it was described unlocked mobile without contract but when received and checked it is locked for t it is not according to given details

2765,Apple iPhone 4s,0,for the first month it operated like new and then the product became defective sent it to apple to get it fixed and they could not do anything for it it is complete and utter waste of my 399 am highly upset but there is nothing can do about it 
2766,Apple iPhone 4s,1,late response this seller offered me fantastic deal on great device the benefit to my review is 2 years later and its still an awesome value m using it to write the review the device arrived as said in better condition then was listed great listed as good and everything works as well as lasted throughly satisfied thank you 
2767,Apple iPhone 4s,1,excellent condition just as describe
2768,Apple iPhone 4s,0,starting with the packaging the serial number did not match on the box and the phone immediately knew something was fishy still decided to give it shot but soon realized that battery did not last more than day all other features were working well contacted amazon about the product and was able to get the return still lot of hassel to go through would recommend spending few bucks extra and buying from wireless store for the peace of mind 
2769,Apple iPhone 4s,1,my previous iphone 4s got washed along with my jeans tried all the recovery tricks but my phone was very clean but very dead didn want to use my upgrade to buy new phone ll wait until the iphone 6 later this year so decided my best approach was to buy used 4s and hang onto it until could upgrade this unit arrived promptly had the latest ios installed meaning no jailbreak was spotless and without blemish recovered the phone from my itunes backup and within 45 minutes was in business still have my clean dead phone thinking about using it as an anchor for model boat 
2770,Apple iPhone 4s,0,phone will not keep full charge even when it shows that it is charged the phone will go out 
2771,Apple iPhone 4s,1,great purchase received brand new 4s m always little apprehensive when ordering products online must say that the reviews on this one got it right received brand new phone and so far it is an amazing buy thank you for being reputable and honest vendor the next time m looking around for good buy your company will be first on the list thanks again

2824,Apple iPhone 4s,1,great company to do business with love my iphone 
2825,Apple iPhone 4s,0,my daughter has literally dozens of cell covers so wanted to stay with the 4s they usually last just about year so not very well made my son has oneplus one and it is much better quality esp the glass and the backing is nicer too and have 3 year old samsung basic phone not smartphone that is still in decent useable condition this has imessage but other than that don think they are worth it we re on our 3rd one already
2826,Apple iPhone 4s,0,phone failed 
2827,Apple iPhone 4s,0,according to the model number recieved and iphone 4 and not 4s the model number is a1332 not a1387 as specified am not satisfied with this purchase 
2828,Apple iPhone 4s,1,bought as gift
2829,Apple iPhone 4s,1,i ve had this phone for about year and half at this point and there are no problems with the phone itself obviously older generations of the iphone run little slower with the new os but that is certainly not the seller fault ll probably keep this phone for at least another 6 months 
2830,Apple iPhone 4s,0,got it for the memory intended to use as i pod replacement for auto sound system couldn get it to cooperate the playback of music was not good quality either
2831,Apple iPhone 4s,0,the battery drains too fast from full charge to 40 then nosedives to zero in no time 
2832,Apple iPhone 4s,1,great phone great price
2833,Apple iPhone 4s,1,good
2834,Apple iPhone 4s,1,awesome ve never bought phone on amazon and was very skeptical broke my phone and needed back up phone until was eligible for an upgrade received the phone and it was just as the description said would definitely recommend this seller fast shipment too

2837,Apple iPhone 4s,0,something was clearly wrong with the phone it would not hold charge after buying new battery and installing the next day the phone the screen went blank and has not worked since have since had to purchase another phone not happy

2873,Apple iPhone 4s,0,i have tried to contact this vendor twice through amazon to get more information on this like new phone wanted to know little more on actual condition and if any accessories are included this is new vendor so am cautious as they have no track record but am serious potential customer this lack of communication does not instill confidence in this supplier have purchased one phone already from another vendor who provided sound information and great service the item was exactly what was described on the amazon site 
2874,Apple iPhone 4s,0,i was really excited to get this new iphone since was looking to replace my 16gb with 32gb however when it arrived 1 it was poorly packaged the box was not sealed on the edges which could have easily been open and stolen 2 sadly the lcd digitizer was defective had to return it this particular iphone must have been from badge of defective lcd digitizer 
2875,Apple iPhone 4s,0,fair price for the 32gb phone 4s battery does not last long but that may be normal wear and tare but expected little more in that sense 
2876,Apple iPhone 4s,1,enjoying new purchase would have been perfect if insurance was offered but the price was right for the product purchased 
2877,Apple iPhone 4s,1,this has been my favorite cell phone ever know you can get bigger screen with the 5s but you can beat the price on this one 
2878,Apple iPhone 4s,0,i purchased this item for its specifications but also for the description of the condition since it was used the description said it was in excellent condition the up volume works great but the down volume does not work at all considered returning it for refund but rarely use the volume switch and otherwise it good in the end it just wasn worth it but do believe that the seller knew this and hid the fact in short the description was not truthful gary kirsheman

2884,Apple iPhone 4s,1,hard to fit certain cables and chargers into the bottom of the case had to buy new ones which were crap and didn work so then ended up machine shopping the super tough plastic at the bottom of the case all the way off so the old cables would fit not waterproof now but can charge the phone and listen to music and it is protected very well otherwise so that something

2900,Apple iPhone 4s,1,i just love my iphone 4s that use with tracfone iphone came in excellent condition and looked brand new there was extra time involved with tracfone but well worth the time to be able to use an iphone one suggestion with dealing with tracfone if the first tracfone person you talk to isn able to help you definitely call back again to get another tracfone person first time called tracfone the guy who sounded intelligent but wasn told me couldn use the phone with tracfone something to do with verizon called verizon verizon also checked out the phone serial number and said it wasn stolen and to call tracfone back was glad called tracfone back tracfone person got knew her job was intelligent very nice and very helpful she spent time on the phone putting in information getting any problems straightened out and was nice the whole time was willing to put time in with the call and was never at any time impatient was told that d lose my minutes from my old tracfone she was able to get around that she put in just few minutes and told me to call back in few days to get the rest of the minutes if the minutes didn automatically show up on the iphone called back and yes it did take time but got all my minutes from my old tracfone live where there is hills and trees and get good reception with the iphone 4s was all the time spent on the phone with tracfone worth it yes now have an iphone and service that doesn cost and arm and leg just remember when calling tracfone if you get someone that doesn help you or is rude definitely call back tracfone does have excellent personal that actually do know their job and are very nice so far the phone is working perfectly 
2901,Apple iPhone 4s,0,verizon says this phone can not be used on their network the phone even says its carrier is verizon but verizon says the imei number can not be found in their network and they have failed to add it also phone appears to be in decent except the front speaker which is filled with ear crud gross 
2902,Apple iPhone 4s,0,was disappointed this phone looked great on the outside but turns out it wouldn hold charge everytime the phone was turned off even with full charge it would have to be charged again to come back on it was christmas present but my son was understanding when broke the news that had to return it thank you to the seller though for processing my refund decided to go with different seller and an iphone 5 instead

2906,Apple iPhone 4s,0,i purchased what thought was brand new phone from this distribute and found out months later that all the minor problems was having with the phone were because it was not new phone when purchased it it did not have it one year apple warranty and when took it to there store was informed it had belonged to someone else and that it was already year old when got it and had water damage that could be seen on the screen and the water damage indicator used by apple was blue indicating water damage also had looked at purchasing phone on ebay and decided not to because did want new phone will be taking all items purchased to have them check from now on

2929,Apple iPhone 4s,1,very good
2930,Apple iPhone 4s,0,the phone works but unfortunately bluetooth does not and the battery life is bit short for an iphone it was decently priced and it is fine for my purposes as back up phone just wish the bluetooth worked update the battery no longer works and hasn in months so this was waste of money guess should have been more concerned with the limited battery life when first got the phone and returned it then oh well it is an expensive lesson learned 
2931,Apple iPhone 4s,1,very good phone 
2932,Apple iPhone 4s,1,i brought this product because my old iphone 4 was accidently dropped on the ground and needed to be replace ordered the wrong one the first time and had to send it back post hast this phone comes with facetime and siri which loved about the first one love facetime since ve been using it lot to talk to my turd headed little brother all the time siri is great what hands free but if your not by wifi it won work it still will work if you have your data plan turned on but that eats up your data plans data it rather pain in the neck would definetly go out and buy this iphone again if needed to thanks seller

2940,Apple iPhone 4s,1,good phone works well thank you
2941,Apple iPhone 4s,1,very nervous about purchasing used cell phone after reading many bad experiences purchasing from warehouse deals ended up being good choice the iphone 4s 32gb arrived on time and looks to be in better shape than the listing indicated listed as good would say at least very good to this date the phone was clean and as advertised correct carrier verizon and memory through about one week of use all seems well with this phone considering it is used the only cosmetic non issue noticed was rings around the volume buttons from the case the prior user protected the phone with so for now it seems to have been great purchase 
2942,Apple iPhone 4s,1,great
2943,Apple iPhone 4s,1,absolutly awesome great experiance
2944,Apple iPhone 4s,1,i wanted an iphone 4s that was used on verizon network that works with tracfone this is the one 
2945,Apple iPhone 4s,1,arrived on time as described excellent refurbished phone for the price could not be happier easy to connect setup to existing phone account no issues encountered 
2946,Apple iPhone 4s,1,it was in good condition glad got it 
2947,Apple iPhone 4s,0,the phone won connect to wifi don know what the hell is wrong with it 
2948,Apple iPhone 4s,0,the phone received was not verizon phone as labeled 
2949,Apple iPhone 4s,0,i purchased this phone and it worked fine for few months but now it constantly makes loud sound like every few minutes have to turn the volume ringer off when going to sleep so it will not wake me up think this phone was refurnished and it was fine for couple of months then the old problem for which it was refurbished came back unfortunately it is way past the returning period and spent over 300 00 for this junk 
2950,Apple iPhone 4s,1,once you go apple you will never go back best investment ever made no problems with soft wear glitches and not getting messages def recommend to friend 
2951,Apple iPhone 4s,1,i ordered this and when received it thought it was in great condition only said good in advertisement there are two things that found later on that made the phone not so great the bottom left speaker doesn work it sounded like the sound was low but just figured was too used to the android was using before so that sucks but not the worst thing in the world the flashlight camera flash doesn work never really use either but noticed when tried to take picture if my sleeping baby one night again not big deal so overall love this phone but there were those two things that compelled me to give four instead of five stars 
2952,Apple iPhone 4s,0,didn seem to be new more like really good shape
2953,Apple iPhone 4s,1,great
2954,Apple iPhone 4s,1,this was definitely great purchaee received the phone as desscribed on time and it works went through nightmare of transaction before this one trying to purchase phone so was very skeptical glad this was an excellent purchase and provider

2957,Apple iPhone 4s,1,for once something that was exactly as advertised m always leery when buy something from new start up 
2958,Apple iPhone 4s,1,i never write review but also never made purchase this big so thought review was necessary at first was skeptical of buying from this company based on some of the reviews but took chance because honestly had nothing to lose am so happy that did the phone came right on time the phone was in perfect condition with the box and couldn be happier the phone works and now don have to deal with my iphone 5 anymore very pleased and if ever need new phone will definitely be buying from this company again 
2959,Apple iPhone 4s,0,i chose this rating because thought was getting verizon phone to use however upon trying to activate the phone m told this device can be used on the verizon network because it has been flashed so it seems that ve wasted about 230 00 dollars on phone can use d return it if could but understand that ve bought pig in poke wouldn recommend this seller or this phone if could get my money back d use it to buy phone from verizon 
2960,Apple iPhone 4s,0,there is problem in the power button does not work at all want solution for that the problem
2961,Apple iPhone 4s,1,great replacement phone no problem at all 
2962,Apple iPhone 4s,1,good phone so far 
2963,Apple iPhone 4s,1,weak battery not sure if design flaw or battery already fatigued 
2964,Apple iPhone 4s,0,this phone was possessed at first the voice activation would just activate itself when no one was touching it then it got little more ballsy and started randomly dialing people in my contacts as if had said call the person in my phone book whom have never called and would never call siri after getting out of the shower one day noticed the phone had me 5 mins into butt dial voice mail that very person in my contacts last straw returned

2972,Apple iPhone 4s,1,i was looking for an iphone for my teenage daughter for christmas but wanted to add the phone to our current trac phone account antiquated know but works for us ordered the iphone 4s from green apple classics and couldn be happier had done lot of research beforehand so knew what to ask gac answered my question clearly and quickly in fact the phone arrived earlier than the expected delivery date it looked brand new and love that it one less cell phone in landfill it did take about 2 hours on the phone with trac phone to get the iphone on our account but so far it works exactly as wanted and my daughter loves it will look to gac for future apple purchases for sure 
2973,Apple iPhone 4s,1,works like charm appreciate the increased space it does get hot did have to replace the screen since the phone jumped off my desk k have not figured out how not to wear down my battery so just carry an extra dual powered battery with me 
2974,Apple iPhone 4s,1,still going strong almost year later
2975,Apple iPhone 4s,0,tried to rate this yesterday with no star not sure if it worked was sold what was advertised as verizon network phone paid for it 250 ish waited more than month for it it is an apple 4s it is not verizon network phone and verizon cannot activate it the transaction was fraud and was left with useless paid for phone 
2976,Apple iPhone 4s,1,this one staying alive and works very well as it should hope it lives to tell the tale teenagers 
2977,Apple iPhone 4s,1,i bought used iphone 4s from icell solution it fit my needs and the price was good when it arrived found it to be in fantastic condition but after using it couple weeks did determine the battery was weak and needed replacement not unusual for phone as old as the 4s contacted the seller and although they do not replace the batteries nor could they ship me one they offered toreplace the phone or pay for the battery if bought one which thought was very gracious and fair of them since like geeking around with this stuff am more than happy to replace the battery thanks to ifixit com am very pleased with my transaction 
2978,Apple iPhone 4s,1,disregard 1st review the company bought the phone from tonkin call me back about the phone issue and resolved it it wasn their phone it was verizon phone works great and thumbs up with the seller thank you 
2979,Apple iPhone 4s,1,i only give 4 stars because the first phone sent didn work but they were very helpful and kind about getting it replaced and the new phone works great 
2980,Apple iPhone 4s,0,the ringer control on the particular unit purchased is not dependable and the speakers are sub par 
2981,Apple iPhone 4s,1,works good good battery life even tho it used does all what it suppose to love having the 32 gb for music movies apps and contacts works great
2982,Apple iPhone 4s,1,good phone for reasonable price the battery seems to work pretty well of course purchased new unopened box iphone 4s 32 gb quite satisfied it

2986,Apple iPhone 4s,0,this iphone purchased was listed as new but first off came with bad cord second the phone will not hold charge and 3rd which is the best one someone from the company or their family recorded ststement on it accidentally saying be careful not to download anything on it avoid this seller
2987,Apple iPhone 4s,0,once the phone gets to 30 or less of battery it just shuts off randomly sometimes can get it back on but usually it just gone until it charged again use different seller 
2988,Apple iPhone 4s,0,i definitely got scammed on this one immediately took the phone to veriozon to be checked out and all seemed good but the battery was shot 
2989,Apple iPhone 4s,1,it looksbrand new and works perfectly live in very rural area and my galaxy sii got poor reception but this iphone is great people can hear me just fine and do not experience dropped calls highly recommend it 
2990,Apple iPhone 4s,1,amazon allowed an individual to list their gently used model it was so well timed and exactly what needed at the time fortuitous and smart placement for the right reasons bravo to internet and the principle used 
2991,Apple iPhone 4s,1,meets my needs

2996,Apple iPhone 4s,1,i am dinosaur and was satisfied with my flip phone when mind started falling apart bit the bullet and bought the 4s not because of reception talk time or any of these areas did rate it high but because of convenience of not having to carry but one toy at time camera note pad mp3 player etc kind of rolled onto one and in my pocket do not spend lot of time on the phone talking texting etc so all can say is that it works when need it just like my old analog phone did gave five stars because had no reason to subtract anything 
2997,Apple iPhone 4s,0,unfortunately this was not good purchase ve only ad trouble with this phone it continuously says roaming phone calls and text won go through and it just got other faulty features also m not one to complain but this was not good purchase especially the amount paid for this 
2998,Apple iPhone 4s,0,purchased this iphone only to find out 30 days after purchasing that is has manufactures defect and the touch pad does not always work contacted the seller they mailed me to inform me had sent the wrong order number responded with the correct order number and never heard back tried mailing two more times to no avail while this was going on the phone died and will not charge used this phone for less than 4 months it is total piece of junk buyer beware 
2999,Apple iPhone 4s,0,i ordered this phone as new phone after only 3 months the screen went dead so brought the phone in to the apple store they opened the phone and told me that the hardware inside was not apple hardware please be aware this is not what it is advertised as

3014,Apple iPhone 4s,0,used phone could not register with verizon it was advertised as new but already had phone number assigned to it esn 
3015,Apple iPhone 4s,1,good
3016,Apple iPhone 4s,0,i give this 0 if could it was advertised as new iphone bought it in dec 2014 it given me nothing but trouble it a real lemon you wouldn believe the messed up things this iphone does no family or friends who all have iphones can believe how terribly this works or should say doesn work so after suffering all this time my husband couldn stand to hear me say one more time what piece of junk got and he bought me really new iphone through verizon wouldn take any chances with this company it was completely false advertising there no way this was new did have suspicions from the start but nothing truly blatant so could tell it had been used before they cleaned it up pretty well think they should refund my money but what are the chances of that happening 
3017,Apple iPhone 4s,0,phone started glitching few days prior to the 30 day return deadline two days after the deadline the phone completely died took it to the local apple store and their diagnosis showed that the phone had been malfunctioning at the hard drive level off and on almost since the day we had it activated explained the situation to cellularstream who continue to insist their is nothing they can do would not recommend buying anything from cellularstream 
3018,Apple iPhone 4s,1,ordered as replacement for 16gb 4s that was nearing the end of it service life it is functionally identical to my previous phone and am happy with it 
3019,Apple iPhone 4s,1,i am very pleased with this phone it was shipped nicely and quickly it has given me zero problems and was as described with some slight scratches on front and back glass thank you

3021,Apple iPhone 4s,1,i very satisfied with my purchase of an apple iphone 4s it was delivered as scheduled and great value look forward to future purchases 
3022,Apple iPhone 4s,1,good job iwolstein this iphone 4s is great the phone is in the right condition as it displayedi hope everyone could enjoy 
3023,Apple iPhone 4s,1,this product was outstanding arrived to me quickly everything works amazingly and there were little to no defects over all was very pleased 
3024,Apple iPhone 4s,0,i dislike that was misinformed about the the product took it to verizon to have activated and they told me that my phone was 16gb
3025,Apple iPhone 4s,0,i will say it openly hated this device had my droid and after many problems decided to try my luck and get this if you hav ever used android devices coming to this is awful syncing previous items thru itunes was pain and the os simply feels too simple the device itself felt like it had to be handled carefully otherwise it would break will recommend it for someone new to smartphones or who has never had android before its good beginner device just did not fit my complex needs 
3026,Apple iPhone 4s,1,my family has verizon family share plan with unlimited data with verizon new policies we cannot get any more subsidized phones without losing our unlimited data plan we currently need to replace few phones with global phones so have been looking at either purchasing new without contract or purchasing used took the risk and purchased used like new phone from amazon warehouse deals the phone arrived in the original box but the box was rather messy and held shut with scotch tape inside the package the charger cable and headphones were all there and appeared to be unused the phone itself had no scratches whatsoever but did have tiny nick in one corner however had to look hard to find it under casual inspection the phone appears brand new the prior owner must have protected the phone well with case and screen protector the phone had been fully reset and cleared so it came up the same as factory fresh phone had no trouble activating the phone with my existing verizon account this was my biggest worry because have purchased used phones before that had been stolen or lost and verizon would not activate them in general if phone is replaced under warranty then the original phone cannot be re activated the only problem have was that the micro sim card was missing normally verizon provides micro sim tied to your own number that is used when you are travelling internationally and need to use the gsm network it is possible that even if the sim was provided it wouldn have worked for me made quick call to verizon and they are sending me free sim in the mail have only been using the phone for two days now the battery seems to be holding charge well will update this review if have any problems with the battery so far so good if don have any problems in the next few weeks will be buying another from amazon warehouse deals am still uncomfortable with purchasing used phone from random vendor updated jan 2014 nine months later and all is well have now purchased three like new 32g iphone 4s models from amazon warehouse deals so everyone in the family has global phone the first two came in previously used iphone boxes the third came with plain cardboard packaging all three phones were in great shape and all three came with headphones charger and usb cable have no complaints whatsoever and will buy from warehouse deals again 
3027,Apple iPhone 4s,1,the price was right the packaging was amazing literally 4 packages inside each other for protection and the phone works perfectly could not have asked for anything better 
3028,Apple iPhone 4s,1,works perfect wife destroyed her first iphone and we did not have insurance on it so bought used iphone and it is working great and this time got insurance for this one 
3029,Apple iPhone 4s,1,i was little hesitant to order refurbished phone but the price was just too good for me to pass up have not found any problems with this phone and am on it alot it arrived on time and looks brand new it only came with getting started book and charger cord 
3030,Apple iPhone 4s,1,after using samsung android smartphone for the past two years it took little getting use to the iphone most of the apps used before come in either the same or nearly the same format for the iphone camera and video are way better than my old samsung 
3031,Apple iPhone 4s,1,the phone came in good time easy to activate w
3032,Apple iPhone 4s,0,i ve been exposed to the process of monument ve bought this phone to be open to my network and it turns out he closed wish could bring him back and retrieve financial
3033,Apple iPhone 4s,0,speakers did not work
3034,Apple iPhone 4s,1,i originally had 16 gb that quickly ran out of memory because of my favorite songs have stored have to say absolutely love the 32 gb have plenty room left can save tons of pictures and music overall became is expected was in perfect condition and am actually writing this review with it 
3035,Apple iPhone 4s,1,still think the droid x2 is better device but this one is easier to keep my music on 
3036,Apple iPhone 4s,0,vender who sold it to me didn make sure it was not on another plan first
3037,Apple iPhone 4s,0,don buy it did and it was black mail
3038,Apple iPhone 4s,0,this iphone 4s 32 gb was presented as new however it was not took it to the apple store and they said it had previous owner with over 600 charging cycles on the battery so it was not new the phone was in good condition so kept it however there were other iphones that were listed as used that were cheaper so because of the misrepresentation payed more thinking was getting new when it was used so far the phone is working fine 
3039,Apple iPhone 4s,1,great
3040,Apple iPhone 4s,1,love it
3041,Apple iPhone 4s,0,worst fear realized you buy an expensive used phone online and it doesn work after spending an entire day on the phone with verizon and apple the issue was found to be from faulty hardware don fall for the same trap did 
3042,Apple iPhone 4s,1,needed replacement and didn want to play games with my cell provider this was prompt exactly what needed and the price was right 
3043,Apple iPhone 4s,1,i bought used one but condition is very good like new as described love it will recommend it to my friends 
3044,Apple iPhone 4s,1,i bought my first iphone off of amazon back in january and still have it no problems with it good as brand new traded it out for my old phone on my verizon plan way before my 2 year upgrade was due because really who can wait that long worked like charm highly recommend 
3045,Apple iPhone 4s,1,this phone was in great condition bought this phone for friend and it came with all of its original packaging and accessories d buy from this person again 
3046,Apple iPhone 4s,0,it came without any of the things it says in the publication it came just the phone has not charger or headphones or even the box 
3047,Apple iPhone 4s,1,i love my 32 gb iphone 4s it is so easy to use and the siri voice function is amazing enjoy to speak text instead of typing 
3048,Apple iPhone 4s,1,i was hesitant to purchase an iphone to replace my previously stolen one online but contacted the seller the he was extremely helpful and understanding went through with my purchase and it didn take long to get here it arrived in the promised condition and still use it to this day m very happy with my purchase and with this seller definitely returning again 
3049,Apple iPhone 4s,1,the iphone was gift for my granddaughter and upon receiving the iphone we had difficultly trying to activate the iphone with verizon immediately contacted the seller and he responded so quickly wanting to do anything to resolve the issue did end up returning the iphone and did receive new iphone that we have connected and it is working great it was good to know that this seller takes pride in providing quality service and product would highly recommend this seller 
3050,Apple iPhone 4s,1,it my first phone and love it the features are easy to use and am very happy with my phone 
3051,Apple iPhone 4s,1,this is very good item we ordered it used looked brand new but they got our order wrong the first time that the only thing wrong but other than that great 
3052,Apple iPhone 4s,0,this phone was listed as 4s it is only 4 got totally swindled as the only reason would of paid that kind of money was fr 4s not happy at all bought as christmas present for my daughter away at college 
3053,Apple iPhone 4s,1,received my phone that was in desperate need of today order it less than three days ago and it already made it here am very happy with it so far thanks 
3054,Apple iPhone 4s,0,the phone has some kinks but overall it works fine kept it will make the best of it hate sounding so uninspired but my experience was somewhat disappointing 
3055,Apple iPhone 4s,1,i finally upgraded to smart phone recently and didn want the 5 because of issues d heard of the 5c and 5s weren out yet after looking at the versions decided that probably wanted at least the 4s because it was the first version with siri what fantastic choice that has proven to be siri is fantastic and if you take the time to know what she can do you ll find that she becomes indispensable to you business colleagues using droids who have seen what can do with siri have frequently made point to quickly find an android siri clone to install on their own phones mean sure the camera is fantastic and you re on an ios device so you have the apple store which is far more populated with cheap free apps than the android stores at the end of the day it going to be siri that makes you glad this phone is in your pocket 
3056,Apple iPhone 4s,1,the phone looks brand new no scratches or anything was able to get it activated with no problem and it was exactly what it said it was 32 gb 
3057,Apple iPhone 4s,1,i like it thanks happy holidays to you too really appreciate it best christmas gift so far to myself 
3058,Apple iPhone 4s,0,got this for my bff because lost hers at cedar point the battery says 45 and then you can watch it you don even have to touch the phone it will drop to 1 and die it a piece of crap and it freezes all the time don waste your money
3059,Apple iPhone 4s,1,the phone works well but found that there is spot on the screen where someone put too much pressure and it is permanently blue color rather than white the only other issue have is the volume changing and some of the speaker areas are very dirty but feel like that is expected for used phone all in all love my iphone 
3060,Apple iPhone 4s,1,what can say about my phone in fact m using it right now what much to say about it absolutely love my phone although m not very fond of apple products but this phone is very versatile many people who hate iphones have androids droids google phones etc what it boils down to is that the iphone is very simple and easy to use it very hard to get confused using this phone and it could do just about anything any other phones can do besides aren all phones about the same these days nothing much is different but phones being smaller faster differently colored slightly better camera etc they re all the same thing 
3061,Apple iPhone 4s,0,the shipment came in quick however the phone that was sent was defective have many missed calls and interruption signals rhat drop my calls m very upset but stuck this purchase never been so diaappointed will have to take the phone to get serviced however if the cost is too high then will opt for purchasing new phone and discarding this 
3062,Apple iPhone 4s,1,this was great phone speed and fast easy os to use and it is iphone enough said lol
3063,Apple iPhone 4s,1,got this iphone use threw amazons warehouse deals and there wasn a scratch or finger print on it looked and operates brand new got 60 month verizon prepaid service on it which is unlimited talk and text with 2 gigs of data this was awesome choice cause have no contract and can cancel any time thanks amazon
3064,Apple iPhone 4s,1,i was very satisfied with the iphone 4s the phone was in excellent condition and described correctly would definitely purchase an item again withou any hesitation thank you for your honesty and great reputation on satisfied reviews 
3065,Apple iPhone 4s,1,at the time was reviewing my options to order phone read the different comments by the sellers as well as the feedback by previous buyers cannot stress the importance of this when ordering phone the long and short is that ordered the same device from another seller first and in the selling comments it implied that the device will ship quickly however if you read the fine print or the delivery window that truly told the story it is my belief that certain sellers may actually list an item more than once and over the several week timeframe they have to ship it out well beleive they end up shipping it to the highest bidder basically never received the phone that was described as perfect might be scam that brings me to this seller not only did receive my phone described as good condition but in reality the phone received was flawless it truly was perfect the original apple box was intact the headphones charging cord and outlet were all in the original packaging sleeves and the phone looked brand new not even tiny scratch we just activated it yesterday and so far so good so m just saying if you are looking at buying used iphone make sure you consider buying from seller with reviews and good ones at that really think this is important to share with others looking for iphones especially after having the bad experience in trying to buy from someone who posted long delivery window believe the delivery window gives them time to achieve the most amount of money while the people who ordered it had their dreams crushed while waiting for phone they thought they would receive what happens is that at the end of the delivery window the seller will send bogus apology letter to the buyer stating that they could not ship it because they found some malfunction on the device swear this happens have such letter to prove it from an order placed on different cell phone several months ago 
3066,Apple iPhone 4s,1,i had been looking for replacement iphone 4s since accidentally drowned my original verizon purchase and ruined it verizon wireless rep suggested that used phones purchased through one of amazon used item stores where probably safe bet referencing an email from amazon based on my past searches looked at the phones sold by amazon warehouse deals this was used phone packed in the original apple sealed packaging no problems cosmetic or otherwise phone was easily set up and activated without any assistance from verizon wireless service reps when activating your phone to replace the dead phone be sure to use the reset to factory settings option under settings which essentially makes your used iphone new phone also found my current icloud backup on the phone and restored that so that my apps and contacts would be current dialing 228 from the new phone will contact verizon wireless and activate the replacement iphone you will be prompted for the number of the phone you are replacing and the last four digits of your social security number to verify you are the legit owner of the account you were asked for this info when the account was created in few seconds your new phone will be activated and ready to use there is no need to follow the documented itunes activation procedures to get the replacement phone online regardless of what other articles say there was no need to know the esn meid of the old or new phones or remove the battery to find this info note that charged iphone displays its meid under settings 
3067,Apple iPhone 4s,0,the seller did really good job on shipping quickly received the phone before the estimated due date which was great what wasn so great was the condition of the phone it wasn like new at all the bottom part where the charging port is was all dented there were also markings on the top part of the phone where the power button is situated amazon description of used like new an apparently untouched item in perfect condition original protective wrapping may be missing but the original packaging is intact and pristine there are absolutely no signs of wear on the item or its packaging instructions are included item is suitable for presenting as gift there were no instructions and no box the phone had been put in bubblewrap and shoved in postage box with the accessories additionally the free accessories that were provided had seen better days the otterbox case was supposed to be white but it was so dirty and scratched it couldn have been used now this may seem like m nit picking but really am not expected like new phone and didn get one when you fork out 349 and it doesn meet your expectations it very disappointing not to mention the fact it a lot of money overall the seller was understanding although he stood by his description and said the condition is subjective and down to the end users interpretation misleading in my book so the phone was returned and did get full refund thankfully 
3068,Apple iPhone 4s,1,awesome phone even better than expected very sleak clean and it had great screen huge upgrade from my previous flip phone still learning how to use the phone but already downloaded approximately 15 apps and all downloaded extremely fast and had no issues this phone is great tool for your life 
3069,Apple iPhone 4s,1,i got the iphone 4s 32gb was expecting some scratches or something but it looks like new very pleased an good price when bought it 
3070,Apple iPhone 4s,0,i bought this phone for my wife as an upgrade and the phone looked immaculate but it only worked for couple of months because the volume stopped working luckily called verizon and due to the fact that the no longer had any replacement iphone 4s phone was sent an iphone 5 instead so in the end it was all worth it 
3071,Apple iPhone 4s,1,grandson likes his phone and the price was good
3072,Apple iPhone 4s,1,works correctly and my daughter loves it 
3073,Apple iPhone 4s,0,battery doesn last very long 
3074,Apple iPhone 4s,0,this was not new the bottom screws came right out they re supposed to be epoxied into place and inside one of the screws holding the ribbon cable in place for the battery was just floating around this was more like bad refurbish job worked for two years which was good two stars though for the price for over 300 it should have worked for three or more 
3075,Apple iPhone 4s,0,the phone was not what is advertised the phone lacked sim card tray condition of the phone was worse than advertised 
3076,Apple iPhone 4s,1,in very good shape works great
3077,Apple iPhone 4s,1,good
3078,Apple iPhone 4s,1,came quickly looked like new and was easy to add as replacement phone to my verizon account couldn be happier 
3079,Apple iPhone 4s,1,good
3080,Apple iPhone 4s,0,iphone 4s came charged had to update having phone for two months now it has some issues it dies at 30 battery and crashes randomly would not recommend to friend 
3081,Apple iPhone 4s,1,customer loves it
3082,Apple iPhone 4s,1,my wife transfered her tracfone flip phone account to this iphone 4s 32gbshe pays only 100 year with no monthly fee she loves it 
3083,Apple iPhone 4s,1,the phone works great however had trouble getting service accepted on tracfone because of the imei finally talked with someone who accepted the receipt from the vendor working through amazon com and got the service have no idea why it was questioned the phone works exactly as expected and everything was precisely as described 
3084,Apple iPhone 4s,1,everything worked out great 
3085,Apple iPhone 4s,0,have had problems with the phone will never buy used phone again disappointing 
3086,Apple iPhone 4s,1,phone works as advertised will say that the charger that came with the phone only lasted for few weeks reason for the 4 star rating 
3087,Apple iPhone 4s,1,yes thank you so much it was perfect 
3088,Apple iPhone 4s,0,worked well but battery life is very low would hope refurbishing would include replacing the battery am considering having new battery installed 
3089,Apple iPhone 4s,1,love the phone highly recommend am not up set must charge batteries just plug it in 
3090,Apple iPhone 4s,0,very disappointed in apple products had nothing but issues with it out of the box none of which were the seller fault it was just an outdated product that needed multiple updates and the updates rendered it unusable will never make that mistake again and will stick with what know with android products
3091,Apple iPhone 4s,1,i just love my iphone 4s that use with tracfone iphone came in excellent condition and looked brand new there was extra time involved with tracfone but well worth the time to be able to use an iphone one suggestion with dealing with tracfone if the first tracfone person you talk to isn able to help you definitely call back again to get another tracfone person first time called tracfone the guy who sounded intelligent but wasn told me couldn use the phone with tracfone something to do with verizon called verizon verizon also checked out the phone serial number and said it wasn stolen and to call tracfone back was glad called tracfone back tracfone person got knew her job was intelligent very nice and very helpful she spent time on the phone putting in information getting any problems straightened out and was nice the whole time was willing to put time in with the call and was never at any time impatient was told that d lose my minutes from my old tracfone she was able to get around that she put in just few minutes and told me to call back in few days to get the rest of the minutes if the minutes didn automatically show up on the iphone called back and yes it did take time but got all my minutes from my old tracfone live where there is hills and trees and get good reception with the iphone 4s was all the time spent on the phone with tracfone worth it yes now have an iphone and service that doesn cost and arm and leg just remember when calling tracfone if you get someone that doesn help you or is rude definitely call back tracfone does have excellent personal that actually do know their job and are very nice so far the phone is working perfectly 
3092,Apple iPhone 4s,0,verizon says this phone can not be used on their network the phone even says its carrier is verizon but verizon says the imei number can not be found in their network and they have failed to add it also phone appears to be in decent except the front speaker which is filled with ear crud gross 
3093,Apple iPhone 4s,0,was disappointed this phone looked great on the outside but turns out it wouldn hold charge everytime the phone was turned off even with full charge it would have to be charged again to come back on it was christmas present but my son was understanding when broke the news that had to return it thank you to the seller though for processing my refund decided to go with different seller and an iphone 5 instead 
3094,Apple iPhone 4s,1,great
3095,Apple iPhone 4s,0,the iphone was in bad shape with screen that had scratched and didn hold charge
3096,Apple iPhone 4s,0,was locked stolen phone
3097,Apple iPhone 4s,0,i purchased what thought was brand new phone from this distribute and found out months later that all the minor problems was having with the phone were because it was not new phone when purchased it it did not have it one year apple warranty and when took it to there store was informed it had belonged to someone else and that it was already year old when got it and had water damage that could be seen on the screen and the water damage indicator used by apple was blue indicating water damage also had looked at purchasing phone on ebay and decided not to because did want new phone will be taking all items purchased to have them check from now on 
3098,Apple iPhone 4s,0,phone was defective
3099,Apple iPhone 4s,1,super 
3100,Apple iPhone 4s,0,despite the guaranteed delivery time the phone came few days late however it works and came as described 
3101,Apple iPhone 4s,1,the phone was in great condition it an excellent product hope to use it for long time however noticed one if the bottom speakers doesn play but other than that phone works great no glitches no cracks or scratches just fluid use 
3102,Apple iPhone 4s,1,first of all didn expect the phone so soon and love this phone have no problems with it it looks brand new as well the seller took excellent care of the phone thank you so much my new toy can put it down unless m working 
3103,Apple iPhone 4s,1,fast shipping as described and no problem activating on verizon network by dialing the 3 digit activation number and following the prompts was able to restore from an icloud update from an iphone that had crashed during the last ios update we will continue to replace phones like this until apple comes up with something that blows away the 4s this is the second phone we replaced through this vendor 
3104,Apple iPhone 4s,1,ok so this was my very first iphone and love it it worked perfectly and got to me in pristine condition there was some confusion on how to unlock it but the sellers gave amazing service and had great attitude helping me out with it sent lot of emails asking for help all issues were resolved and it works perfectly even now 3 11 14 
3105,Apple iPhone 4s,1,good price wish they would of told me it had after market back but for the price paid knew there had to be some type of alteration
3106,Apple iPhone 4s,0,frustrating to get phone that was listed as perfect working order get it switch over to find out the top power and the down volume buttons do not work am giving 2 stars because the seller was good about returning the product 
3107,Apple iPhone 4s,0,i was so excited to recieve my 32gb black iphone 4s it was delivered within 2 days which made me extremely happy as well however when opened the box found white iphone not big deal switched the phone over with ease and everything was perfect until realized it wasnt 4s either already had white iphone 4 why would want another one am so dissapointed called amazon and they recommended just get refund now have to send back the phone was so excited to get and order another phone probably from ebay cool this will be the last time order from amazon for while 
3108,Apple iPhone 4s,0,this phone worked good for about month or so then memory shut down and it failed miserably was purchased as christmas present what letdown 
3109,Apple iPhone 4s,1,it the best segway into newer iphone model it came faster than expected in great like new condition amazon warehouse deals arran excellent source for discounted products 
3110,Apple iPhone 4s,1,love the more storage and teh siri the speed is great too cheap for now until can aford the 5
3111,Apple iPhone 4s,1,shipped promptly and able to activate without issue 
3112,Apple iPhone 4s,0,the phone was listed as new but more than enough evidence to convince me that is not the case scratches on the case and the hotspot and bluetooth features don work battery life also seems bit on the short side these challenges probably go with buying three year old design from an aftermarket dealer on the plus side the 4s has much much much better phone capability than the iphone 5 series on my iphone 5 dead from dunking was lucky when could carry on conversation in our house or inside building not so with the 4s which is always rock solid an apple tech explained that from the 5 series on apple switched to smaller and less capable antenna to save space and money bad choice apple very bad 
3113,Apple iPhone 4s,1,all good 
3114,Apple iPhone 4s,1,really good as described for verizon
3115,Apple iPhone 4s,0,after having the phone for several months it has multiple little issues drops wifi the screen flashes when trying to take photo apps just turn off at random screen shot will shut down the phone drops calls etc 
3116,Apple iPhone 4s,0,not verizon phone as advertised rather t mobile had to return 
3117,Apple iPhone 4s,0,i just received my phone and it is the wrong carrier the outside of the box says verizon but went to activate it and it is sprint phone seriously annoying would have given zero stars but it wouldn let me 
3118,Apple iPhone 4s,0,not what you pay for when ordered this phone it was listed as new picked this one even though it was more expensive because it was listed as new within few weeks of getting this phone had some issues that were minor when would swipe down the at glance view wouldn pull down couldn close some of my apps because the close button was high the top right corner few weeks later was notified that my email accounts were trying to be accessed from weird places and my facebook account had been accessed from another country and at about 2 months the phone just shut off and wouldn turn on made an appt at apple and drove the 1 5 hours to have them look at my new phone after the tech tries to reload the software and there are still bugs tell him don understand bought the phone 2 months ago he askes from friend say no new in box with shrink wrap and sticker price that said new he says no this phone was manufactured in 2011 it 2014 now so say no he sends my phone to the back and they tell me the serial on the box the inside casing and one displayed in settings are all different the screen isn working correctly because it wasn an apple screen and they can work on the phone at all get amazon to take it back and see if they can send me verified new one they can so imagine my surprise when they charge me 65 to restock used phone because they didn send me what paid for in the first place 
3119,Apple iPhone 4s,1,the phone itself works very well the cover was too big but was glad used it anyway good deal
3120,Apple iPhone 4s,1,great phone but not better than the 5s
3121,Apple iPhone 4s,0,i was told was buying 4s and recieved an iphone 4 not 4s the home button sticks and it in crappy condition 
3122,Apple iPhone 4s,1,quick to ship my iphonethe phone works greatcame with the accessorieskept their promisesi recommend this product

3124,Apple iPhone 4s,1,the performance of iphone are legendary that is why it is the benchmark these days in mobile communication devices my daughter just loves her new phone the battery life is really good but highly recommend the boostcase products they almost almost 18 hours of usable battery life and that with teenager hamering away on it 
3125,Apple iPhone 4s,1,i like it it was like new en everthing like what expectedno scratch no signs of use 
3126,Apple iPhone 4s,0, without checking the serial number against the lost and stolen list with your carrier we made the mistake of buying used iphone 4s without doing that and after we received it from an amazon vendor we found that it could not be activated because it was previously listed as lost or stolen to amazon credit they refunded our money through their to guarantee but don put yourself in that position check the serial number with your carrier before you buy 
3127,Apple iPhone 4s,1,you re still new to it held off from smart phone for while to keep from becoming internet dependent this was my first smartphone and m very happy with it be careful though once you get this you might really get into it and want the latest and greatest iphone 5 thinner faster lighter 
3128,Apple iPhone 4s,1,this was great item would recommend them to anyone looking for phone great iphone purchase 
3129,Apple iPhone 4s,1,i recovered the product faster than expected and in excellent condition it didn come with the proper iphone box but did have headphones and charger 
3130,Apple iPhone 4s,0,i ordered this and as opened the box noticed there was no plastic wrap around the box then opened up the box and the phones jack looked used and it wasn a verizon phone it was already used before with sprint figured well maybe its just me either way took it to verizon and they had problem programming the phone well decided to get all the guess work out the phone was not new but used and it was not verizon phone sent it back via amazon love amazon they know what to do mean the phone was over 600 00 dollars why would anyone think people would not notice these things they took it back even apologized well of course don cheat honest people not all of us are unaware of what we get

3139,Apple iPhone 4s,0,verizon could not activate this phone it has verizon sticker on the box with an activation number but it cannot be used verizon could not activate the phone because this is not verizon phone they said furthermore when verizon put in their sim card not included with the phone how stupid is that window on the iphone itself popped up that said invalid sim card this phone will not support this carrier do yourself favor don buy posted 5 november 2014 why this post otherwise shows an october date have no idea 
3140,Apple iPhone 4s,1,very good
3141,Apple iPhone 4s,1,replacement for an iphone apple refused to look at for warranty issues due to after market installed non original oem part ridiculous beware of apples warranty policy otherwise love the iphone
3142,Apple iPhone 4s,1,overall think that this is good phone can compare this against any of the other phone available today 
3143,Apple iPhone 4s,1,not activated when received some scratches are on the back and border great felling of using easy to upgrade ios 
3144,Apple iPhone 4s,0,i bought that iphone as my first iphone ever the very first days of use it works normally then starts the problems it shuts down repently and did lose the information no saved finally someone stole my iphone only had it for two weeks try to trace my iphone with the software find my iphone but it dont work and was sure of activate that program and sign me up in icloud im in peru now live here and want my money back 
3145,Apple iPhone 4s,1,i liked it very much battery was not lasting like new one but still got deal 
3146,Apple iPhone 4s,0,i purchased this device several weeks ago thinking would receive phone in good condition instead the speakers were blown out and the seller never mentioned the speakers being unusable can only call people using headphones and can listen to music without my headphones being plugged in in order to get this fixed would have to pay apple 200 because she already used out the warranty highly recommend that you don buy any products from this seller due to false advertisement overall am very disappointed with my iphone4s 
3147,Apple iPhone 4s,1,excellent purchase really came as new cell hope that future purchases are so good and as new products
3148,Apple iPhone 4s,1,very minor blemishes arrived when expected included the ear buds in original case worked out of the box with straight talk solid deal 
3149,Apple iPhone 4s,1,works great would recommend this company to anybody for purchases they make have no problems at all with this phone 
3150,Apple iPhone 4s,0,this review is for the apple iphone 4s 32gb white at i received the product in strong undamaged packaging the packaging was adequate and strong enough to protect it from any damage from the perils of shipping this is an excellent product the reason took two stars away because of how apple has spent so much time and energy fighting jailbreaking if they would only provide half the seriously useful tweaks that the cydia store does would not jailbreak as of now im lucky to be on ios 5 1 1 since can jailbreak and use the tweaks ive bought will not upgrade to the iphone 5 since it cannot be jailbroken and ios is lacking many features that ive come to rely on that cydia provides have used the iphone since its second iteration 3g and have upgraded religiously every time apple has released new one but am seriously considering switching to an android phone for my next smartphone if jailbreaking continues to get more difficult update 2016 07 10 did move on to android after my experiences with the 4s am happy with the move and have not bought another apple product since android is flexible and more open platform disclaimer all opinions have expressed are my own and derived from actual use of and experience with the product only leave positive feedback and reviews when the product meets my expectations when am making my decision to buy product online rely heavily on other reviews and feedback in turn will only leave fair honest and unbiased review of each product in the hopes that it will help others make informed decisions about the products they are considering purchasing 
3151,Apple iPhone 4s,1,apple iphone 4s 32gb white at like new when got the phone first time found the accessory headphone wire was bent but test the function ok have used it for 2 months the ios 7 system is very reliable no big scratch was found on the cell phone 
3152,Apple iPhone 4s,1,it work like new it looks new excellent love it its come on time also was las money very good 
3153,Apple iPhone 4s,1,excelente
3154,Apple iPhone 4s,0,i bought this phone to use it in venezuela it came locked to be used only with at not as advertised 
3155,Apple iPhone 4s,0,i bought brand new iphone 4s 32gb about week ago just received it in the mail few days ago looked at it looked into the ports charging ports and head phone port there was dirt within it it was all warn down on the site it said they had new ones they sent me refurbished phone my receipt said it was brand new phone still in the original packaging would not recommend anyone to buy from this buyer they are scamming everyone selling used phones for the price of brand new one 
3156,Apple iPhone 4s,1,buying used iphone the seller matters do not just look at the price read the description and check the sellers feedback scores lot of the reviews you see for the phone are actually seller feedback which is not what am here to do just bought used iphone 4s here in the amazon marketplace and love it it runs all of the features need from ios 7 including the moving wallpaper well okay maybe don need that performance is excellent with noticeable bump over my iphone 4 which is also running ios 7 quite nicely without the moving wallpaper this is the first version of the iphone that had siri and m surprised to find that am using that feature quite bit there is also bump in network speed over the iphone 4 is it worth it to upgrade to 4s from 4 at this point for me yes use mobile and wasn on board with signing new contract to get 5c or 5s this works fine for me use it as phone text messenger lo fi point and shoot camera ipod and reader it does all of these without hiccup and don owe anyone any money 
3157,Apple iPhone 4s,1,love the phone hate the company apple is bloodsucking company and its sad stop making so many phones and just put great technology in 1 phone that won be outdated in 6 months ffs
3158,Apple iPhone 4s,1,my family purchased several of these directly from amazon because amazon offers 30 day return policy careful the other sellers may not allow returns they all arrived in near new condition small dirt fuzz in speaker and charging ports arrived in new boxes with new accesories and new instruction all worked like new all already out of apple warranty had all unlocked on ebay for 1 99 each now works fine on mobile seems to data stream fast enough was worried because heard that seconarily unlocked phones dont data stream as fast as phones made specifically for mobile purchased directly from tmobile or apple 
3159,Apple iPhone 4s,1,i got 64g iphone which haven think of how to use with such huge phoneit great for me to have unlocked phone now

3165,Apple iPhone 4s,1,iphone 4s works perfectly m also glad it runs ios eight with voice activation have had it for three days now and had no problems everything runs smooth especially the games 
3166,Apple iPhone 4s,0,had to change the battery it wasn holding charge vey long switched it with the battery from my broken 4s and works great now 
3167,Apple iPhone 4s,1,excellent nice condition thanks alot
3168,Apple iPhone 4s,1,it an iphone what more can say unfortunately m not an apple fan will say did like the feel of the phone the fact that it was 32gb so was able to put all of my music videos books and apps was great with still great number of space left although phones now range to 7 which is ridiculous this phone would appear to be tiny but actually liked the size not huge but still able to maneuver with no issues for someone staring to use smartphones this would be good idea 
3169,Apple iPhone 4s,1,arrived in good condition as it was described 
3170,Apple iPhone 4s,1,perfect as described 
3171,Apple iPhone 4s,1,works great
3172,Apple iPhone 4s,1,all works well condition better than stated
3173,Apple iPhone 4s,0,i couldn connect to wifi the wifi was grayed out was like seriously otherwise it was fine
3174,Apple iPhone 4s,0,i received 16 gb white iphone 4s instead of 32 gb and what item received is there is no modem firmware and it doesn detect wifi and also the battery is no good doesn charge anymore it means that did not received the right item that expect 
3175,Apple iPhone 4s,0,it was not even at it was locked to some canadian company fido so retured it got money back
3176,Apple iPhone 4s,1,awesome phone and great shipping 
3177,Apple iPhone 4s,1,phone arrived in apple original package very nice and in perfect working condition love it 
3178,Apple iPhone 4s,1,excellent iphone worth the buy
3179,Apple iPhone 4s,0,apperantly the package got lost so didn get my item at all was really mad and waiter for 3 weeks the only thing got was my money back
3180,Apple iPhone 4s,0,we bought what we thought was brand new phone new in box is what our receipt said and we just found out from apple it was 2 years old when it was shipped to us in new and new wrapped apple box 
3181,Apple iPhone 4s,0,if you are considering buying phone from amazon warehouse deals reconsider ordered an iphone 4s that was considered like new their definition of like new product is like new item sold on amazon warehouse deals is in perfect condition but due to the condition of the packaging it does not meet amazon com standards for new product for customer returned product it possible that the previous customer opened and removed the product from the original packaging if returned item comes back in perfect physical condition and through our testing process we determine the working condition is perfect the item may be deemed like new physical damage to the outer box of factory sealed item in our warehouse can also lead to the condition being taken from amazon com new to amazon warehouse deals like new my iphone arrived in the mail and took it in to the at store to get it set up right away the employee who was working with me told me that my phone was damaged the home button is wobbly and loose and when you talk on the phone with someone the quality of sound is terrible was told it already has blown speaker would not consider this phone in perfect working condition at all this leads me to believe that amazon either tested the phone and still sold it as like new while knowing full well that the phone had issues or it was an oversight on their part either way very disappointing purchase will not be buying from amazon warehouse deals again and it makes me rethink making purchases from amazon in the future 
3182,Apple iPhone 4s,0,one of the buttons wasn working it was obvious since the minute opened the box did contact the sender and he did offer to send another but he didn want to pay for me returning the item this was so unfair because it wasn my fault don want to deal with someone like this again send the thing back and end up with less money in my pocket 
3183,Apple iPhone 4s,1,the iphone is simple to use and works great plus this model doesn have the lightning adapter which seems to be more trouble than it worth cables cost twice as much video and audio out are limited compared to the 30 pin and aftermarket products can be difficult to come by 
3184,Apple iPhone 4s,1,this phone came unlocked just added new simm and away went did not have to reconfigure anything worked great right out of the box 
3185,Apple iPhone 4s,1,this phone was in absolutely perfect condition all of the additional accessories were included in pristine condition as well highly reccomend this product to everyone couldnt be more satisfied 
3186,Apple iPhone 4s,1,the phone was as advertized in excellent condition like new phone this was very good deal thank god 
3187,Apple iPhone 4s,1,this was the best used iphone could find it came in right shape and no scratches love it
3188,Apple iPhone 4s,1,the cell phone is white iphone 4s but amazon gives me black earphone furthermore cann activate the cell phone with sim card of other carrier but sheetal staff of service department help me to solve the problem he is good man 
3189,Apple iPhone 4s,0,it clearly say ordered at iphone 4s but received verizon locked iphone 4s so really got screwed out of about 220 
3190,Apple iPhone 4s,1,looks as good as new works great battery may not be as good as new one but is still good battery just not quite as good as new have two other 4s to compare

3196,Apple iPhone 4s,0,cannot get too excited about 4s but it worked fine no problems 
3197,Apple iPhone 4s,0,bought like new mobile phone think it is used several times the results found that the mobile phone has been used for more than year the number of cell cycle 512 times very disappointed
3198,Apple iPhone 4s,1,works although battery didn last as long but maybe 32 gig or extreme cold weather subjected phone too
3199,Apple iPhone 4s,0,i bought this phone about 2 weeks ago it was in really good condition no scratches dents or cracks when got it but after the 2 day noticed it wouldn hold charge for more then an hour or so very disappointing so for that give this 2 stars 
3200,Apple iPhone 4s,0,ok
3201,Apple iPhone 4s,1,love the iphone 4s 
3202,Apple iPhone 4s,1,4s is great phone but slower than 5 and much slower still than 5s it still fully updates with the 5s unlike regular 4 haven really had any issues with it but faster is always better 
3203,Apple iPhone 4s,1,good price
3204,Apple iPhone 4s,0,the camera didn function well camera flip didn work at all 
3205,Apple iPhone 4s,0,the batt didn stay charged at all had to send back nice return tho
3206,Apple iPhone 4s,1,good
3207,Apple iPhone 4s,1,4s the best iphone what apple has done now have 6 plus it too big and too heavy you can not hold it in your hands safely 4s was the best 
3208,Apple iPhone 4s,1,this is legit placed my order 1 27 16 and got it 1 30 1 it came faster than had expected today is the first day but so far love it can afford the other phone prices so this works for me the fact that it comes with all of the accessories tells me got good phone will definitely let other people thanks so much

3212,Apple iPhone 4s,1,excellent quality like brand new only thing is one of the speakers was not working 
3213,Apple iPhone 4s,1,great phone the only reason am not completely satisfied with this is because it has bit of charging problem when plugged into computer other than that everything works great and love it 
3214,Apple iPhone 4s,1,the iphone came in awesome new condition and works great couldn be more happy with this purchase great place if you need new iphone 
3215,Apple iPhone 4s,0,it has very obvious scar the side the front also has scar it is not like new product am very disappointed

3218,Apple iPhone 4s,1,my iphone 4s arrived on time brand new in orginal packaging ear buds and charging system included have no issues at all quite happy with the phone and the coat paid for it
3219,Apple iPhone 4s,1,got just what was looking for loved the price very happy with my purchase of the phone 4s 
3220,Apple iPhone 4s,0,this iphone looks good but headphone is cheap copy like this iphone but hate this headphone anyway headphone is not too necessary for me
3221,Apple iPhone 4s,0,disappointing that you are not informed of what is missing to properly decide whether it is deal breaker it did not make it any better to be told that paperclip tip can do the trick did not buy the item wit using paperclip in mind because could have opted for other choices so the point is should make an informed decision my son was leaving for abroad in 2 days when it came so returning it was not going to work 
3222,Apple iPhone 4s,0,a used phone with poor battery and no accessories earns it 2 stars otherwise an iphone 4s is an iphone 4s so its great build and very great os in it one nice feature is the ability to have reminders go off based on geographic location its great on that 
3223,Apple iPhone 4s,1,i was skeptical at first on buying an iphone since was an android fan love my iphone it came in perfect condition brand new also it came to my house in exactly 4 days just like they said it would am now an iphone lover 
3224,Apple iPhone 4s,0,i love apple products love the iphone but hate when online sellers choose to lie and be dishonest about lies after the costumer has already received the product it is not fair when someone is receiving 400 easily by selling used phone 
3225,Apple iPhone 4s,1,excellent product it was more than expected works perfectly and smoothly it also arrived earlier than expected really like it it awesome 
3226,Apple iPhone 4s,1,wish it had back button for each screen other than that love it it is very fast and like the capacity 
3227,Apple iPhone 4s,1,well what can say except the iphone is the top of the line cell phone for me have had an iphone since the first day it launched great phone and easy to use my husband was anti apple but has since changed his tune since receiving his iphone 4s let just say he will not be turning back now 
3228,Apple iPhone 4s,1,replacement for an iphone apple refused to look at for warranty issues due to after market installed non original oem part ridiculous beware of apples warranty policy otherwise love the iphone
3229,Apple iPhone 4s,1,overall think that this is good phone can compare this against any of the other phone available today 
3230,Apple iPhone 4s,1,not activated when received some scratches are on the back and border great felling of using easy to upgrade ios

3249,Apple iPhone 4s,0,caution what he sells to you is something that does not work opened my brand new purchased thinking it was new not refurbished iphone and tried to set it up while was in the car it told me to hook it up to itunes so did on my laptop but it gave me an error took it to the apple store and was notified that it had been wet that there was red spot on top of the phone that notifies that it had been tainted with water notified the seller and he tried to blame it on me saying that if had wet it somehow like really got it and saw it did not work and took it to the apple store which was told that would have to buy whole new one because this phone does not have warranty in any way not even the 30 day warranty that you should get and he advertises would ask the seller questions about the iphone and he was very rude asked him if can have refund and he said well guess knowing the amazon policies so if it was up to him he would not refund anything even though he is selling cheap stuff that does not work at all it is just waste of money if you guys go and buy from him 
3250,Apple iPhone 4s,1,perfect delivery and match as per my requierement and perfect packaging and good quality and looks very nice plastic color fast connection

3253,Apple iPhone 4s,0,i ordered refurbished version of the phone thinking it would be fine the customer service received through the process like when had to cancel the order and re order it was amazing both from amazon and the seller however once received the phone the camera on it was all out of whack making pictures turn green or other strange colors live overseas in korea now and there are no apple stores here so took it to someone who did repairs who had to take out the camera and put in new one because the one it had was fake next time ll go for the new one besides this no issues except crap battery but that seems to be common with iphones 
3254,Apple iPhone 4s,1,it was in great shape but didn want international phone without facetime and it wouldn take my card for u a mobile

3529,Apple iPhone 4s,0,product of poor quality bought and brought me to use outside the usa so it took me time to be able to test the device to my surprise the microphone did not work and all so the battery does not recharge properly as am not in the usa had to arrange myself the repairs to use the device which has cost me about us 60 00 apple iphone 4s 16gb unlocked white certified refurbished 
3530,Apple iPhone 4s,1,i was wrong took this to the apple store because thought it needed new battery they showed me how to put it on airplane mode since am not using it as phone they also helped me set the settings so that it is not on all of the time they did diagnostic test on the battery and showed me the battery was fine it was just my settings that were making the battery run down fast so do not use this as phone but rather as way to have my music my car stereo died while back so listen to this phone in the car and while am on my fast 1 7 mile walk

3535,Apple iPhone 4s,1,fine very good
3536,Apple iPhone 4s,1,although am weary of refurbished products figured d give this go because of how cheap it was had bought this for my mother at the beginning of june she has used it ever since with no problems iphone 4s is still great phone today but if you are using it on straight talk plan be aware they will not be able to add the 4g lte plan they begin using 4g with the iphone 5 very satisfied with my purchase

3594,Apple iPhone 4s,0,i was using an iphone 6 but it was lost to the water this looked like good option until the new iphone 7 are released unfortunately the performance difference is significant between this phone and an iphone 6 the battery is really weak and normally requires charging before the day is over the phone is super slow the camera is slow to open apps are terrible not sure if it is the ios 9 on iphone 4 or the phone is bad but this thing is much slower than the iphone 4 had years ago overall the phone is very frustrating to use

3600,Apple iPhone 4s,0,sending it back apps can not download as this phone can only take up to ios 7 and all the new apps are now using ios 9
3601,Apple iPhone 4s,1,the phone works great m just not an iphone person 
3602,Apple iPhone 4s,1,lasted for around 27 days now it won hold charge loved it when it first game updated it to ios 9 1 2 and it screwed me over not even month what it don even know what to do edit product works it was just the power brick that came with it it no longer works do have another power brick and the phone does hold charge 
3603,Apple iPhone 4s,1,works like brand new phone works great 
3604,Apple iPhone 4s,0,although this did not come with original accessories as stated knock off charger and no headphones which were include in the original accessories of the iphone 4 the phone seems to work fine for my teenager the exterior is in excellent shape will update when take it to our carrier 
3605,Apple iPhone 4s,1,it was in great condition and received it just as they stated
3606,Apple iPhone 4s,0,i ve got to be honest was little leary about this product ordered it then looked at the reviews boy were they unappealing to read was super nervous about what had just ordered but to my surprise it was just fine yes the phone is unlocked but the box it came in said it would not work for any sprint or sprint affiliated carrier so that was confusing the battery is just as everybody says discharges super fast and turns off when its around 20 phone looked brand new no scratches powered right up and put my sim card in service kicked right in overall not bad 
3607,Apple iPhone 4s,0,this iphone 4s 16gb is not good what was expected the product have several problems like sensor button is not working there are scratches on front side and also didn receive the ear hones with my phone and also when m calling the phone got hanged m loyal customer to amazon but have ever received this kinda product before very dis pointed 
3608,Apple iPhone 4s,0,i looked for refurbished iphone 4s coz know its hard to find brand new this time so as expected it came with all the accesories with the phone but sad to say it does nt meet my expectation coz notice they send me the wrong usb cable it for the iphone 5 and so on not for the 4s so just find some old cable of mine and there my phone works good but after few days the charger itself are busted and does nt charge anymore so again have to find solution by myself hope the phone will not die soon like the charger that have 
3609,Apple iPhone 4s,0,received this phone and it is not completely unlocked it is only unlocked to at t
3610,Apple iPhone 4s,0,the phone wasn working good at all be full charge and it dies any secound even 100 
3611,Apple iPhone 4s,1,great product met all my expectationswould buy again 5 stars
3612,Apple iPhone 4s,0,extremely disappointed purchased the phone as unlocked it had att label on the box and did not read my sim card called and got replacement which was no different than the first one also locked the overall quality of the phone is bad and the charger parts do not fit properly into each other the first one charged over night and the battery emptied out after few hours without any use as the phone was not even activated also had problems with the shipping company they do not stick to the hours they post on the website they told me the item was delivered when it was still on its way now after wasting four days between the first one and the replacement will have to go through the headache of returning the 2 phones 
3613,Apple iPhone 4s,1,love it came in pristine condition meets all criteria excellent service and value 
3614,Apple iPhone 4s,0,we bought this so we could use the trulink for hearing aids the iphone will not sync to the starkey aid as it should expected better from amazon this lick was why we bought the phone

3621,Apple iPhone 4s,1,nan
3622,Apple iPhone 4s,0,the wifi is not work 
3623,Apple iPhone 4s,0,had the phone for 5 weeks and the phone is dead too late to return or exchange it good way to get my money 
3624,Apple iPhone 4s,0,it completely failed when inserted the new sim card it did not work had specifically asked for an unblocked phone that could use during my trip to tabzania and had to buy phone there instead total waste of money 
3625,Apple iPhone 4s,1,phone delivered on time and in excellent condition was able to activate it completely on my own and it is working fine fifth star would have been merited except somewhat degraded battery performance overall consider it very good purchase

3640,Apple iPhone 4s,0,phone dead on arrival only turning on for few seconds when plugged in with battery at 100 change returned same day 
3641,Apple iPhone 4s,0,there is definitely something wrong with the battery when you charge it to full battery in about 1 hour it says low battery and think there is also problem with the microphone the most disappointing is that ordered it as gift and it did not work properly 
3642,Apple iPhone 4s,0,the condition of the phone was near mint but there was something wrong with the battery would charge it to full battery and 1 hr later it will say low batt so basically need to have outlet near me at all times 
3643,Apple iPhone 4s,0,the iphone does not work its not been 2 or 3 months bought it and it does not work at all now gets switched off even with full battery and screen shows loading sign with no other display 
3644,Apple iPhone 4s,0,not factory unlock not working gsm carriers
3645,Apple iPhone 4s,0,i bought this phone amd ve not even had it two months and the speaker has already gone out of it 
3646,Apple iPhone 4s,0,everything is good clean no straches however the battery doesnt hold charge longer than about three hours at time
3647,Apple iPhone 4s,0,it works it doesn hold charge all day but it is ok for now not sure would buy refurbished again especially from this seller due to the under charging 
3648,Apple iPhone 4s,1,aside from relatively quickly dying battery phone is very good please be sure to understand your carrier service provider cellular phone requirements before buying this 
3649,Apple iPhone 4s,0,it a good quality phone had problem updating it but after that works fine but someone changed the password to my account so might be something but overall okay buy

3652,Apple iPhone 4s,1,excelente
3653,Apple iPhone 4s,0,phone is in very good condition but the battery is completely useless and thus the phone is useless even after following every iphone tip on closing all apps changing several settings the battery still only lasts couple of hours without being used for even single phone call the battery is drained in about 3 hours even when the phone is not in use as longtime iphone user know very well about battery problems ve also owned 4s like this one before this battery should have been replaced for product with certified refurbished label it was definitely not what was expected

3656,Apple iPhone 4s,0,phone was not unlocked as stated it was verizon contract phone buyer beware 
3657,Apple iPhone 4s,0,this refurbished phone has very very low sound you can hear it ring and you can hear people talking to you in audio chats like skype it says it is certified refurbished guess for the price the figured you can do without sound purchased two in white as well one wouldn hold charge and the other also had low sound not worth the low price 
3658,Apple iPhone 4s,0,charger and cable not compatible so that buy charger and cable from other store
3659,Apple iPhone 4s,1,great phone for the price
3660,Apple iPhone 4s,0,this product is sold as being unlocked and compatible with mobile after going through the long process of resetting the phone using itunes it will not work with the mobile sim card useless 
3661,Apple iPhone 4s,1,nan
3662,Apple iPhone 4s,1,actually sounds good not bass heavy but crisp sound 
3663,Apple iPhone 4s,0,it looked fine but after couple of days there is no media sound it went to head set mode and could not reset back to normal hardware problem 
3664,Apple iPhone 4s,0,didn work bad seller
3665,Apple iPhone 4s,0,this is probably the worst 90 ever spent first off got an empty package so had to order another one and wait again second the wifi antenna is damaged can connect to wifi unless m next to the router the screen froze twice the same day alone and now the screen went completely dark barely can see some light out of it this is completely bad product or maybe don understand refurbished the same way as this seller

3756,Apple iPhone 4s,1,to my relief my phone worked fine ironically could not activate on verizon as prepaid phone but it worked fine with tracfone do not have any battery issues this is just backup phone anyway it is not being used as primary phone use it while travel so don risk losing the more expensive version of this phone
3757,Apple iPhone 4s,1,i was looking for certified refurbished iphone 4s and found one through dealfisher received the phone promptly with no visible scratches it took some time to charge the phone and the wall plug attachment got hot the phone worked fine otherwise but charging continued to be an issue charging the phone directly on the computer was better but had problems keeping the charge function going as it would beep in and out of charge mode contacted dealfisher where olivia replied promptly and immediately offered to send replacement phone received that phone within 4 days and it is working well so far olivia also sent me prepaid mailing label to return the faulty phone not only was olivia customer service prompt but she was very responsive and understanding am very happy with the phone and the company 
3758,Apple iPhone 4s,1,working great well pleased
3759,Apple iPhone 4s,0,got my iphone and the home button was broke
3760,Apple iPhone 4s,0,so far one of the phones has been working good the other one seems to be havingproblems with the wireless adapter since while downloading some apps it got really slow so turned the wireless adapter off in order to reboot it and it never came back on again m actually trying to figure out how to return it none of the phones came with the puncher to be able to insert the sim card no manuals and no headphones
3761,Apple iPhone 4s,0,phone died and won turn on after 92 days 90 day warranty very dissapointed contacted the seller and hoping they will still honor the warranty although am 2 days over will post and update 
3762,Apple iPhone 4s,1,great
3763,Apple iPhone 4s,0,device did not work to its potential
3764,Apple iPhone 4s,0,wifi and bluetooth is not working
3765,Apple iPhone 4s,1,first let me say m windows insider person m on the fast ring of beta testing my real phone is lumia 950 xl the ones before it were also windows and the ones way before that were android all motorola so this is my first apple phone because 3 4 of my family are apple people we won go into why but blame it on the schools they use facetime lot so hence if want to be part of the social circle have to use apple as for the phone it an okay phone like live tiles better than static apps like the power of windows 10 mobile siri has nothing on cortana microsoft phones are durable and work as well as any with apple reputation so usually only use the iphone on wifi but this certified refurbished phone works and works consistently my one big complaint is it uses micro sim instead of nano sim can swap sims to use cellular service on my main number bought this one for the extraordinary price but see another nano sim model certified refurbished iphone in my future unless of course apple decides to share facetime and itunes with other platforms like microsoft shares office skype wunderlist and many other apps with it competitors btw m what would be considered an elderly woman and not some it professional 
3766,Apple iPhone 4s,0,phone would not hold charge so had to purchase solid battery from reputable seller 
3767,Apple iPhone 4s,1,item worked well as expected

4101,Apple iPhone 4s,1,all good
4102,Apple iPhone 4s,1,all good
4103,Apple iPhone 4s,0,battery was not that good need to charge twice day very narrow screen 
4104,Apple iPhone 4s,0,no work
4105,Apple iPhone 4s,1,the phone works fine with ios 9 3 5 however the 4s is sluggish to keep up with opening apps google maps for instance does take longer to load overall it a little slow but it all works the screen does have yellow hue to it its not crisp clear color also can get the idea out of my head that this refurbished phone has proprietary spyware installed to monitor calls texts and photos to activate the camera and microphone pretty much access anything on the phone it didn come with an official apple refurbish phone certification just came in bag the refurbished 4s is great deal m just paranoid thinking there a catch 
4106,Apple iPhone 4s,1,it is awesome have been wanting an iphone 4s for while now and finally got the money to buy it the phone works 100 you can add carrier to it it works just like any other iphone too
4107,Apple iPhone 4s,0,llego well but with the default screen calls chokes and reheated too when charging the battery would give me warranty then could not make the claim before because just week ago get the product because am from venezuela and slow as can solve this problem 
4108,Apple iPhone 4s,0,i bought the iphone 4s two months ago and no longer works so useless that is cheap if not hard so m very upset with my purchase
4109,Apple iPhone 4s,1,seemed just like new works fine and great value check here first if you need new phone 
4110,Apple iPhone 4s,1,okay but looks some costly
4111,Apple iPhone 4s,1,extremely pleased
4112,Apple iPhone 4s,1,i recently purchased this phone as birthday present for my son had this phone back when it was first released by apple and had no issues with it this phone was refurbished and came in looking brand new the only difference was the fact that it came in plain box and with no headphone it did include the charger and cable however he has been using the phone now for few weeks and it has worked flawlessly if you are looking to buy phone outright would definitely opt for refurbished model buy many items that have been on the market for while refurbished and have never had any problems with operation or aesthetics of them 
4113,Apple iPhone 4s,0,phones appear to be in good condition not sure about them being new and the after market accessories are very cheap the usb cable came apart while charging the first time reported to customer service via email but have yet to hear back so just went to find my own replacement hopefully the phones hold up longer than the charger 
4114,Apple iPhone 4s,1,its good exactly what is pictured
4115,Apple iPhone 4s,1,everything was fine 
4116,Apple iPhone 4s,0,not buying it does not work does not play audio from videos or ring when they call no charge and am now in colombia and can not return it and amazon is not responding

4217,Apple iPhone 4s,0,the phone was in perfect shape as far as the appearance once got it activated had to update the ios to be able to use itunes and the apple store the phone worked fast until started taking pictures and downloaded few apps it uses more data than any other phone ve ever used it usually takes me month and half to run out of 2gb of data but with this phone it took two weeks have even turned off lot of applications from running in the background the absolute worst thing about it is that the battery life with minimum usage typically last me 2 hours god forbid make one five minute phone call it drains the battery down completely within five minutes usually have to use it plugged into the charger it has features that love but really don believe will keep this phone just because of the consistent low storage warning low battery life and slow system wanted to return it but didn know how

4310,Apple iPhone 4s,1,i was conscious of buying iphone online due too so many people getting ripped off by broken iphone sent to them or stolen one that can be activated even best advice can give read the sellers reviews and positive reviews number anywhere between 90 to 98 you should be fine have been wanting iphone for awhile but don have 600 to shell out for one about this iphone it is 4s it has sim card slot side it was unlocked phone which it maybe but said cell phone carrier verizon so my best guess it is unlocked and previous owner used them either way it worked just fine with straight talk could text and send photos have sim card slot but did not have to use it they ask me for some numbers and it worked the video is ok would say lot better then old cellphone 1080 30p good for taking pics with family friends video or good stand by but by no means should this be used for professional filmography the buttons are on the left two volume buttons up and down and button to set the phone to ring on be silent theres home buttom that is round wit square graphic the to button right issleep shut down towards the left is head phone jack and what seems to be mic wifi works the apps store is great you can download free magic app or google voice to make free wifi calls wifi does work it runs ios 9 3 the newest one memory 16gb you may want to little more on 32 gb icloud gives you 5gb free which is not lot

4352,Apple iPhone 4s,0,after year of buying this iphone from this vendor had to send it to repair at apple store to my surprise discovered that this item was sold to me as new but was not new it was refurbished in china or hong kong was not new item do not trust this vendor he does not sell new items he sells refurbished as new be careful 
4353,Apple iPhone 4s,1,first iphone have always used blackberry am happy with the iphone 4s works well and ios easy to use have not used siri don like the fact that you have to have an account at apple with credit card on file if you want to download any apps even free ones you cannot set up the account without entering valid credit card but if you use itunes card min ve ever seen is 15 you don need to enter credit card happy with the product find nice headphones and sound is ok found cowon much better as mp3 player though for music quality 
4354,Apple iPhone 4s,0,ordered the product to use overseas was suppose to be unlocked s not should have read all the reviews first talked to apple they said report was already generated on this serial number therfore it must have been sold once and was refurbish this isn advertized either so buy at your own risk update contacted suppier about the product they provide me with the instructions to unlock the phone after several failed attempts they recommended returning the product they gave me the option of replacement or my money back less stocking fee opted for refund although the phone did not work as advertize eve in the customers relations dept did her best to help me she replied promptly to all my mails and did her best to make it work so have to say even though the product didn perform as promised the company did everything it could to satisfy me

4406,Apple iPhone 4s,0,from all the complains seen on here after bought the phone should have told me to return the phone have been spending two weeks trying to get the phone to work overseas an now it is to late to return my suggestion pick another phone the phone 4 is not worth the trouble or gamble to see if your going to get 1 that works or not 
4407,Apple iPhone 4s,0,ordered the new product because the listing stated factory unlocked by apple never opened inside of the non factory shrink wrap was masking tape on both ends the original serial number sticker was covered over by different serial number sticker for similar product upon checking the warranty for the phone using the serial number the apple site said we re sorry but this is serial number for product that has been replaced please check your information and re enter your serial number if your information is correct you may need to contact us since the serial number is correct it either refurbished phone or phone that has been used there was no factory warranty as the listing stated always check the warranty on the iphones if you re buying factory unlocked phone there are lot of people who will unlock an old phone and attempt to sell it as new did not open the package but promptly contacted amazon for refund 
4408,Apple iPhone 4s,1,because it is iphone
4409,Apple iPhone 4s,1,i got this phone few weeks ago and love it would recommend anyone to buy it
4410,Apple iPhone 4s,1,its very fast and looks good at the beggining but now runs hot and the back cover is not original
4411,Apple iPhone 4s,0,iphone appeared new however the battery was not great as time went by the battery got worse and worse to the point where not only could it not hold power it had to be continuously connected to the wall in order for the phone to remain open and working all this within months of purchase within 6 months of use it became useless 
4412,Apple iPhone 4s,1,good 
4413,Apple iPhone 4s,1,as described however the battery dies at 18 if it not in low power mode it charge up quick though

4423,Apple iPhone 4s,0,pour battery life time it does not stand even one hour 
4424,Apple iPhone 4s,1,work very good and connect whit any company
4425,Apple iPhone 4s,0,not the white one initially intended got black one instead and the headphone jack started having problems from the getgo but to be fair the seller did offer to exchange it or offer me full refund but at the time just needed phone so bad that why m can give him full 5 stars but been using it for afew months now and no complaints 
4426,Apple iPhone 4s,1,was new and sealed in the box with all in side packaged by apple phone was great was 4s 32 and unlocked by apple am now using metro pcs now

4428,Apple iPhone 4s,1,the cellphone is perfect im so happy have nothing to complain you can buy to this guys without problems 
4429,Apple iPhone 4s,0,caution what he sells to you is something that does not work opened my brand new purchased thinking it was new not refurbished iphone and tried to set it up while was in the car it told me to hook it up to itunes so did on my laptop but it gave me an error took it to the apple store and was notified that it had been wet that there was red spot on top of the phone that notifies that it had been tainted with water notified the seller and he tried to blame it on me saying that if had wet it somehow like really got it and saw it did not work and took it to the apple store which was told that would have to buy whole new one because this phone does not have warranty in any way not even the 30 day warranty that you should get and he advertises would ask the seller questions about the iphone and he was very rude asked him if can have refund and he said well guess knowing the amazon policies so if it was up to him he would not refund anything even though he is selling cheap stuff that does not work at all it is just waste of money if you guys go and buy from him

4433,Apple iPhone 4s,0,i ordered refurbished version of the phone thinking it would be fine the customer service received through the process like when had to cancel the order and re order it was amazing both from amazon and the seller however once received the phone the camera on it was all out of whack making pictures turn green or other strange colors live overseas in korea now and there are no apple stores here so took it to someone who did repairs who had to take out the camera and put in new one because the one it had was fake next time ll go for the new one besides this no issues except crap battery but that seems to be common with iphones 
4434,Apple iPhone 4s,1,it was in great shape but didn want international phone without facetime and it wouldn take my card for u a mobile 
4435,Apple iPhone 4s,0,this is very bad ordered 32 gb factory unlocked iphone got 16 gb with bad wifi and not really god battery

4437,Apple iPhone 4s,0,advertised as new in the box sealed original shrink wrap never opened iphone 4s factory unlocked received item not shrink wrapped minor marring on edges of iphone locked to at dirty places on box no way this is just mistake clearly mass hit or miss on order recipients as to who will or will not make fuss about it and odds are many will use at as their carrier upon receipt so it would not even come up hate being baited and switched by anyone have asked for return and replacement but will change to just return and refund as do not trust seller now

4516,Apple iPhone 4s,0,it functions as an iphone ll give you that the description says never opened and new in shrink wrap and original packaging though mine came with screen glitch which lead me to believe this was used phone and it was because it had tiny chip in the phone and the camera failed to focus unless you shook the phone few times nonetheless it been almost 6 months and there haven been any problems aside from the screen glitch it better than no iphone

4564,Apple iPhone 4s,0,from all the complains seen on here after bought the phone should have told me to return the phone have been spending two weeks trying to get the phone to work overseas an now it is to late to return my suggestion pick another phone the phone 4 is not worth the trouble or gamble to see if your going to get 1 that works or not 
4565,Apple iPhone 4s,0,ordered the new product because the listing stated factory unlocked by apple never opened inside of the non factory shrink wrap was masking tape on both ends the original serial number sticker was covered over by different serial number sticker for similar product upon checking the warranty for the phone using the serial number the apple site said we re sorry but this is serial number for product that has been replaced please check your information and re enter your serial number if your information is correct you may need to contact us since the serial number is correct it either refurbished phone or phone that has been used there was no factory warranty as the listing stated always check the warranty on the iphones if you re buying factory unlocked phone there are lot of people who will unlock an old phone and attempt to sell it as new did not open the package but promptly contacted amazon for refund 
4566,Apple iPhone 4s,1,the cellphone is perfect im so happy have nothing to complain you can buy to this guys without problems 
4567,Apple iPhone 4s,1,i got this phone few weeks ago and love it would recommend anyone to buy it
4568,Apple iPhone 4s,1,its very fast and looks good at the beggining but now runs hot and the back cover is not original
4569,Apple iPhone 4s,0,iphone appeared new however the battery was not great as time went by the battery got worse and worse to the point where not only could it not hold power it had to be continuously connected to the wall in order for the phone to remain open and working all this within months of purchase within 6 months of use it became useless 
4570,Apple iPhone 4s,1,good 
4571,Apple iPhone 4s,1,as described however the battery dies at 18 if it not in low power mode it charge up quick though

4576,Apple iPhone 4s,0,the ringer vol on this phone is so low it can not be heard if you are holding the phone also can not find the number pad to dial out the battery will only hold charge for about 30 minutes it is very hard to operate it was not designed for people that are older it is just complex and too hard to understand all can say is do not waste your money on it it is joke have got 9 emails from amazon so far with no satisfaction this my recommendation don buy any thing from amazon unless you want to lose your money or western phone trade 6200 north meeker st suite 100 boise id 83713 which was the supplier 
4577,Apple iPhone 4s,1,i had an upgrade to 64 gb and it working good recieved it on time and no issues at all so far

4580,Apple iPhone 4s,1,works fine easy to get hooked up with month to month service provider verizon wouldn hook me up unless it was their phone so their loss 
4581,Apple iPhone 4s,1,if you are the type of person that always wants to have the newest gadget stop reading here for all the others that want to have great phone at great price the iphone 4s is your first choice it offers lot more than the 4 and not lot less than the 5 believe me this is great deal

4647,Apple iPhone 4s,0,caution what he sells to you is something that does not work opened my brand new purchased thinking it was new not refurbished iphone and tried to set it up while was in the car it told me to hook it up to itunes so did on my laptop but it gave me an error took it to the apple store and was notified that it had been wet that there was red spot on top of the phone that notifies that it had been tainted with water notified the seller and he tried to blame it on me saying that if had wet it somehow like really got it and saw it did not work and took it to the apple store which was told that would have to buy whole new one because this phone does not have warranty in any way not even the 30 day warranty that you should get and he advertises would ask the seller questions about the iphone and he was very rude asked him if can have refund and he said well guess knowing the amazon policies so if it was up to him he would not refund anything even though he is selling cheap stuff that does not work at all it is just waste of money if you guys go and buy from him 
4648,Apple iPhone 4s,1,perfect delivery and match as per my requierement and perfect packaging and good quality and looks very nice plastic color fast connection
4649,Apple iPhone 4s,0,the guy cheat to me because he sent me locked phone without headphone but ordered locked phone am kind of dissapointed
4650,Apple iPhone 4s,1,i am quite satisfied with this purchase it is ok rate price product is good and really it was as new 
4651,Apple iPhone 4s,0,i ordered refurbished version of the phone thinking it would be fine the customer service received through the process like when had to cancel the order and re order it was amazing both from amazon and the seller however once received the phone the camera on it was all out of whack making pictures turn green or other strange colors live overseas in korea now and there are no apple stores here so took it to someone who did repairs who had to take out the camera and put in new one because the one it had was fake next time ll go for the new one besides this no issues except crap battery but that seems to be common with iphones 
4652,Apple iPhone 4s,1,it was in great shape but didn want international phone without facetime and it wouldn take my card for u a mobile 
4653,Apple iPhone 4s,0,this is very bad ordered 32 gb factory unlocked iphone got 16 gb with bad wifi and not really god battery 
4654,Apple iPhone 4s,0,my flash does not work receive only the cable without battery don have the legal document to requist the consert so now what can do 
4655,Apple iPhone 4s,0,advertised as new in the box sealed original shrink wrap never opened iphone 4s factory unlocked received item not shrink wrapped minor marring on edges of iphone locked to at dirty places on box no way this is just mistake clearly mass hit or miss on order recipients as to who will or will not make fuss about it and odds are many will use at as their carrier upon receipt so it would not even come up hate being baited and switched by anyone have asked for return and replacement but will change to just return and refund as do not trust seller now 
4656,Apple iPhone 4s,1,phone was like the description like new no marksworking perfectly with all the functions only need to put my carrier simcard 
4657,Apple iPhone 4s,0,this would have been really great buy but it is almost useless without service verizon had this phone listed as lost stolen and will not activate it wth 
4658,Apple iPhone 4s,0,i did good review first time because iphone arrived quickly and it looked good and turned on but when tried to connect 2 months later because had emergencies that side tracked me from connecting it right away was informed by verizon that they couldn because the phone was sold was in their records stolen of course was so embarrassed because know paid for it with my credit card and have proof got charged and paid my credit card so can only think that got sold stolen or lost iphone that can use at all 
4659,Apple iPhone 4s,1,love this phone have seen and heard this phone is better than iphone 5 and that is from people who upgraded to iphone 5 
4660,Apple iPhone 4s,1,flawless and excellent price
4661,Apple iPhone 4s,1,fast delivery phone exactly as described 
4662,Apple iPhone 4s,1,great phone
4663,Apple iPhone 4s,1,it is working fine with no problems bought it as gift for my wife she loves the extra memory had called verizon wireless prior togetting the phone from vw learned that had to use my computerand itunes to do an encrypted backup then had to restore the itunes backup using my computer tothis new phone by having an encrypted backup all her old 4s 8bgiphone passwords and photos and etc were restored to the new iphone and finally had to have my wife dial 611 to give them the new phonesmeid number the new phone has been excellent my wifes so happy and thatmakes me happy 
4664,Apple iPhone 4s,1,delivered on time worked great out of the box no complaints 
4665,Apple iPhone 4s,1,good 
4666,Apple iPhone 4s,1,other than the phone arriving week later than expected everything was great 
4667,Apple iPhone 4s,1,it was in great shape but the battery doesn hold very good 
4668,Apple iPhone 4s,0,at first it was great but then it only lasted 9 months and the dock broke and apple told me have to get new phone
4669,Apple iPhone 4s,1,bought it for the 64 gigs it meets all my requirements and is also good phone 
4670,Apple iPhone 4s,1,apple iphone even better than could have imagined was in great shape and was totally satisfied with this purchase and the seller only concern was fed left package on chair facing the parking lot where live instead of placing package behind the chair so no one could have seen it other than that am very satisfied customer and will surely recommend using amazon again for future purchases of these king 
4671,Apple iPhone 4s,1,though it starting to show its age my iphone 4s really is solid overall device at this price point it a great entry level phone for those considering switching to iphone but don want to be roped into long contract highly recommend this device and also purchasing it used from the amazon warehouse store 
4672,Apple iPhone 4s,0,the phones were probably fine the problem was that they were advertised as new but their warranties were expired in my mind that negates their new status they were in fact used and as is and that could be false advertisement also much too expensive under those circumstances 
4673,Apple iPhone 4s,1,thx for the purchase it saved me from having to upgrade to the five or whatever the current version is this will give me few years of breathing room 
4674,Apple iPhone 4s,1,great phone it is arguably the best iphone to date the 5 5s 5c pale in comparison build ease of use perfect design how do you improve on that you don t
4675,Apple iPhone 4s,1,the cosmetics were flawless it came in an iphone 4s box with the accessories the short term difficulty with registering it with verizon were quickly handled by technician and then set up with verizon pay monthly plan short term use indicates no obvious problem with battery life or working of the iphone find it unfortunate that apple seems not to take into consideration the low vision users when making changes to the ios the seller was willing to answer what questions had that he could it is important to realize that purchasing not new product like the iphone depends as much on the seller as it does on the product 
4676,Apple iPhone 4s,1,worked as advertised hope everyone has as good an experience as have had no problems have shown up in the phone with about 1 week of use 
4677,Apple iPhone 4s,1,after trading some confusing emails back and forth we finally figured out my address who knew was so hard to find the phone is excellent and the people were persistent thanks for my new phone
4678,Apple iPhone 4s,1,the phone was in great condition functions very well only problem is with the battery life but that is given when you buy used phone the previous owner most likely wore it down all and all good buy the phone was also shipped extreamly fast 
4679,Apple iPhone 4s,0,i will be sending this phone back for return and full refund had high hopes that this phone would work with pageplus celluar unfortunately after week received this the mic started to malfunction to the point where could only hear people if put them on speaker phone wish this would of worked out because the price was great 
4680,Apple iPhone 4s,1,my phone was awesome until shattered it no one could believe the price paid for it very satisfied will be order tin another soon 
4681,Apple iPhone 4s,1,iphone 4s with 64 gb of memory was everything thought it would be an arrived in perfect working order and the price was great
4682,Apple iPhone 4s,0,i would of gave it five stars the phone looked great the only issue was that it was still attached too the previous owners itunes account there for was unable to activate this phone 
4683,Apple iPhone 4s,1,awesome iphone appreciate the amount of gigs it can hold now look forward to larger screen 
4684,Apple iPhone 4s,1,came on time just as described 
4685,Apple iPhone 4s,1,the best phone ve ever owned 
4686,Apple iPhone 4s,1,i had the 5s 16 gb hated to downgrade but tracfone wouldn support the 5s the 4s had before and it was fine don know why had to upgrade in the first place the 4s is perfectly capable as phone 
4687,Apple iPhone 4s,1,item was what was expected 
4688,Apple iPhone 4s,1,i like to store some music and some videos to watch when go somewhere to wait on someone and have enough room for apps
4689,Apple iPhone 4s,1,phone was as advertised am using it with tracfone and all seems well love this phone very happy with it not happy about iphone not supporting mpoints but the phone itself is great 
4690,Apple iPhone 4s,1,phone was in great condition and was great price 
4691,Apple iPhone 4s,0,knew that the phone was used but was not aware that it would have so many scratches chipped glass this should ve been mentioned 
4692,Apple iPhone 4s,0,i paid more than usual and was assured new phone however received an old refurbished cell phone instead what waste of time 
4693,Apple iPhone 4s,0,microphone does not work took to the apple store they said it had to replace it returning phone
4694,Apple iPhone 4s,1,quick delivery and great phone exactly as described and good price too 
4695,Apple iPhone 4s,1,awesome phone took some getting used to the ios but it been great device very please with how fast it arrived and how powerful it is am m5 communications knocked it out of the park on this one
4696,Apple iPhone 4s,1,good job
4697,Apple iPhone 4s,1,i traded my 4 8gb for the 4s 64gb and it made my life easier now have plenty of memory for pictures music documents without having to delete something just to save picture
4698,Apple iPhone 4s,0,i purchased three phones for the family these phones were advertised as brand new was disappointed to find out that they were actually used phones ranging from 10 months to two years of prior use when activating them at verizon have decided to keep two of the phones as they are working well but had to return my son phone as he started experiencing errors immediately went to the apple genius bar and they said should return the phone as the logic board had been tampered with and they suspected problems with the cpu as well believed that was purchasing three new phones for the kids and but that wasn the truth 
4699,Apple iPhone 4s,0,purchased used phone advertised as like new although phone arrived in original packaging and all external appearances iwere as advertised the phone receiver volume is so low that it is for all practical purposes unusable diagnostic at apple store resulted in conclusion that the internal receiver speaker was defective and not repairable no warranty apple offered to exchange for 199 or suggested that consult my carrier in the end have killer music device but for phone it it is about useless caveat emptor 
4700,Apple iPhone 4s,1,i am not going to review the iphone 4s there are millions of reviews out there and can add anything love the phone ordered the iphone 4s 64 gb black verizon version from amazon warehouse deals it was described as like new it was new in shrink wrapped apple box with all accessories in the box as well was able to switch it with my old samsung stratosphere which had grandfathered unlimited data plan online at the verizon website with no problems was able to keep my data plan have had the phone for day now and it is great thank you amazon warehouse deals 
4701,Apple iPhone 4s,1,i know the description says it may be scratched and have some wear but got this phone early and it looked brand new got the phone about three days early there was no scratches and appears fresh out of the box nothing but good things to say phone looks and works great thank you rebound
4702,Apple iPhone 4s,1,my teenaged daughter loved her iphone 4 but only had 16gb of storage for her music and photos wait it a phone right so this is the perfect solution she gets an upgrade on the storage to 64gb and gets siri without switching to an iphone 5 saves us the huge cost of new phone 5 which she doesn want she keeps the version iphone 4 she loves important be sure you check the specific item details to make sure the phone you re buying is the right one for your carrier we were lucky the phone we bought said verizon in the description and it only took us few minutes to get it authorized as replacement on our verizon account consider asking the seller for the imei number found in general about imei to confirm the phone will work or is not stolen before you buy it the purchase will take longer but is the only guarantee that once you receive the phone it will work hopefully your purchase will be successful like ours
4703,Apple iPhone 4s,0,i was expecting the phone to be in better condition than received it one of the speakers doesn work at all and there are 2 pretty big dents along the edges of the phone 
4704,Apple iPhone 4s,1,this is my first iphone bought it after my droid phone started acting crazy losing memory and deleting my photos love this phone had an ipad before purchasing this phone so had no difficulties making the switch from droid to an iphone it needs the ios7 update which haven had the time to download yet 
4705,Apple iPhone 4s,1,works just as had hoped my xpert kids made it tough start for me but works great and looks great 
4706,Apple iPhone 4s,1,the phone was everything that was advertised am very glad was able to purchase this phone at reasonable price 
4707,Apple iPhone 4s,1,the user interface is well done very intuitive really like the bright screen and vivid screen down side expensive
4708,Apple iPhone 4s,1,very good recommend it all came as was bit slow charm thanks but congratulate taste good sellers
4709,Apple iPhone 4s,1,after my first iphone 4s was stolen knew wanted another one but was afraid to purchase online was not disappointed the phone was is great shape and is working brilliantly for me thanks
4710,Apple iPhone 4s,1,apple iphone even better than could have imagined was in great shape and was totally satisfied with this purchase and the seller only concern was fed left package on chair facing the parking lot where live instead of placing package behind the chair so no one could have seen it other than that am very satisfied customer and will surely recommend using amazon again for future purchases of these king 
4711,Apple iPhone 4s,1,though it starting to show its age my iphone 4s really is solid overall device at this price point it a great entry level phone for those considering switching to iphone but don want to be roped into long contract highly recommend this device and also purchasing it used from the amazon warehouse store 
4712,Apple iPhone 4s,0,the phones were probably fine the problem was that they were advertised as new but their warranties were expired in my mind that negates their new status they were in fact used and as is and that could be false advertisement also much too expensive under those circumstances 
4713,Apple iPhone 4s,1,thx for the purchase it saved me from having to upgrade to the five or whatever the current version is this will give me few years of breathing room 
4714,Apple iPhone 4s,1,great phone it is arguably the best iphone to date the 5 5s 5c pale in comparison build ease of use perfect design how do you improve on that you don t
4715,Apple iPhone 4s,1,the cosmetics were flawless it came in an iphone 4s box with the accessories the short term difficulty with registering it with verizon were quickly handled by technician and then set up with verizon pay monthly plan short term use indicates no obvious problem with battery life or working of the iphone find it unfortunate that apple seems not to take into consideration the low vision users when making changes to the ios the seller was willing to answer what questions had that he could it is important to realize that purchasing not new product like the iphone depends as much on the seller as it does on the product 
4716,Apple iPhone 4s,1,worked as advertised hope everyone has as good an experience as have had no problems have shown up in the phone with about 1 week of use 
4717,Apple iPhone 4s,1,after trading some confusing emails back and forth we finally figured out my address who knew was so hard to find the phone is excellent and the people were persistent thanks for my new phone
4718,Apple iPhone 4s,1,the phone was in great condition functions very well only problem is with the battery life but that is given when you buy used phone the previous owner most likely wore it down all and all good buy the phone was also shipped extreamly fast 
4719,Apple iPhone 4s,0,i will be sending this phone back for return and full refund had high hopes that this phone would work with pageplus celluar unfortunately after week received this the mic started to malfunction to the point where could only hear people if put them on speaker phone wish this would of worked out because the price was great 
4720,Apple iPhone 4s,1,flawless and excellent price

4764,Apple iPhone 4s,1,this is an excellent device with extremely high quality build would still recommend apple over any other brand they are still bit pricey and would do well to build mid range product line 
4765,Apple iPhone 4s,0,everything went wrong m not saying that there was bad intention on behalf of the sales people because they tried everything to help me get it going but it just was not unlocked and had very poor experience due to the fact that was traveling and had no time to replace it finally had to stay with my iphone 4 which still have amazon attitude was not as expected but they followed the process was promised full reimboursement because it was not unlocked as published that included my expenses for shipping and they did not comply better to forget experience

5427,Apple iPhone 4s,1,it was in great condition and received it just as they stated
5428,Apple iPhone 4s,0,i ve got to be honest was little leary about this product ordered it then looked at the reviews boy were they unappealing to read was super nervous about what had just ordered but to my surprise it was just fine yes the phone is unlocked but the box it came in said it would not work for any sprint or sprint affiliated carrier so that was confusing the battery is just as everybody says discharges super fast and turns off when its around 20 phone looked brand new no scratches powered right up and put my sim card in service kicked right in overall not bad 
5429,Apple iPhone 4s,1,no problem so far so good

5523,Apple iPhone 4s,1,is in perfect condition and is unlocked all ports work well it is just as fast as my other iphone 4s was and can download the current iso only problem is that the phone gets really hot really quickly and the battery seems to run out little faster than normal comes in fancy box with clear top and charger

5527,Apple iPhone 4s,1,the telephone is in exquisite condition also everything is wonderful in regards to the performance of the telephone should the need occur in the future there will not be any hesitation for me to purchase another telephone by using amazon com 
5528,Apple iPhone 4s,0,the phone is good but you sent me the wrong charger had to buy another one

5533,Apple iPhone 4s,1,okay but looks some costly
5534,Apple iPhone 4s,1,extremely pleased
5535,Apple iPhone 4s,1,i recently purchased this phone as birthday present for my son had this phone back when it was first released by apple and had no issues with it this phone was refurbished and came in looking brand new the only difference was the fact that it came in plain box and with no headphone it did include the charger and cable however he has been using the phone now for few weeks and it has worked flawlessly if you are looking to buy phone outright would definitely opt for refurbished model buy many items that have been on the market for while refurbished and have never had any problems with operation or aesthetics of them 
5536,Apple iPhone 4s,0,phones appear to be in good condition not sure about them being new and the after market accessories are very cheap the usb cable came apart while charging the first time reported to customer service via email but have yet to hear back so just went to find my own replacement hopefully the phones hold up longer than the charger

5652,Apple iPhone 4s,0,product of poor quality bought and brought me to use outside the usa so it took me time to be able to test the device to my surprise the microphone did not work and all so the battery does not recharge properly as am not in the usa had to arrange myself the repairs to use the device which has cost me about us 60 00 apple iphone 4s 16gb unlocked white certified refurbished 
5653,Apple iPhone 4s,1,i was wrong took this to the apple store because thought it needed new battery they showed me how to put it on airplane mode since am not using it as phone they also helped me set the settings so that it is not on all of the time they did diagnostic test on the battery and showed me the battery was fine it was just my settings that were making the battery run down fast so do not use this as phone but rather as way to have my music my car stereo died while back so listen to this phone in the car and while am on my fast 1 7 mile walk

5923,Apple iPhone 4s,1,i was conscious of buying iphone online due too so many people getting ripped off by broken iphone sent to them or stolen one that can be activated even best advice can give read the sellers reviews and positive reviews number anywhere between 90 to 98 you should be fine have been wanting iphone for awhile but don have 600 to shell out for one about this iphone it is 4s it has sim card slot side it was unlocked phone which it maybe but said cell phone carrier verizon so my best guess it is unlocked and previous owner used them either way it worked just fine with straight talk could text and send photos have sim card slot but did not have to use it they ask me for some numbers and it worked the video is ok would say lot better then old cellphone 1080 30p good for taking pics with family friends video or good stand by but by no means should this be used for professional filmography the buttons are on the left two volume buttons up and down and button to set the phone to ring on be silent theres home buttom that is round wit square graphic the to button right issleep shut down towards the left is head phone jack and what seems to be mic wifi works the apps store is great you can download free magic app or google voice to make free wifi calls wifi does work it runs ios 9 3 the newest one memory 16gb you may want to little more on 32 gb icloud gives you 5gb free which is not lot

6438,Apple iPhone 4s,0,because the body is all score up tough that the casing was going to be changed
6439,Apple iPhone 4s,0,the phone was in perfect shape as far as the appearance once got it activated had to update the ios to be able to use itunes and the apple store the phone worked fast until started taking pictures and downloaded few apps it uses more data than any other phone ve ever used it usually takes me month and half to run out of 2gb of data but with this phone it took two weeks have even turned off lot of applications from running in the background the absolute worst thing about it is that the battery life with minimum usage typically last me 2 hours god forbid make one five minute phone call it drains the battery down completely within five minutes usually have to use it plugged into the charger it has features that love but really don believe will keep this phone just because of the consistent low storage warning low battery life and slow system wanted to return it but didn know how

6592,Apple iPhone 4s,1,i was wrong took this to the apple store because thought it needed new battery they showed me how to put it on airplane mode since am not using it as phone they also helped me set the settings so that it is not on all of the time they did diagnostic test on the battery and showed me the battery was fine it was just my settings that were making the battery run down fast so do not use this as phone but rather as way to have my music my car stereo died while back so listen to this phone in the car and while am on my fast 1 7 mile walk

6622,Apple iPhone 4s,1,okay but looks some costly
6623,Apple iPhone 4s,1,extremely pleased
6624,Apple iPhone 4s,1,i recently purchased this phone as birthday present for my son had this phone back when it was first released by apple and had no issues with it this phone was refurbished and came in looking brand new the only difference was the fact that it came in plain box and with no headphone it did include the charger and cable however he has been using the phone now for few weeks and it has worked flawlessly if you are looking to buy phone outright would definitely opt for refurbished model buy many items that have been on the market for while refurbished and have never had any problems with operation or aesthetics of them 
6625,Apple iPhone 4s,0,phones appear to be in good condition not sure about them being new and the after market accessories are very cheap the usb cable came apart while charging the first time reported to customer service via email but have yet to hear back so just went to find my own replacement hopefully the phones hold up longer than the charger 
6626,Apple iPhone 4s,1,its good exactly what is pictured
6627,Apple iPhone 4s,1,everything was fine 
6628,Apple iPhone 4s,0,not buying it does not work does not play audio from videos or ring when they call no charge and am now in colombia and can not return it and amazon is not responding 
6629,Apple iPhone 4s,1,works great 
6630,Apple iPhone 4s,1,working great well pleased
6631,Apple iPhone 4s,0,got my iphone and the home button was broke
6632,Apple iPhone 4s,0,so far one of the phones has been working good the other one seems to be havingproblems with the wireless adapter since while downloading some apps it got really slow so turned the wireless adapter off in order to reboot it and it never came back on again m actually trying to figure out how to return it none of the phones came with the puncher to be able to insert the sim card no manuals and no headphones
6633,Apple iPhone 4s,0,phone died and won turn on after 92 days 90 day warranty very dissapointed contacted the seller and hoping they will still honor the warranty although am 2 days over will post and update 
6634,Apple iPhone 4s,1,great
6635,Apple iPhone 4s,0,device did not work to its potential
6636,Apple iPhone 4s,0,wifi and bluetooth is not working
6637,Apple iPhone 4s,1,first let me say m windows insider person m on the fast ring of beta testing my real phone is lumia 950 xl the ones before it were also windows and the ones way before that were android all motorola so this is my first apple phone because 3 4 of my family are apple people we won go into why but blame it on the schools they use facetime lot so hence if want to be part of the social circle have to use apple as for the phone it an okay phone like live tiles better than static apps like the power of windows 10 mobile siri has nothing on cortana microsoft phones are durable and work as well as any with apple reputation so usually only use the iphone on wifi but this certified refurbished phone works and works consistently my one big complaint is it uses micro sim instead of nano sim can swap sims to use cellular service on my main number bought this one for the extraordinary price but see another nano sim model certified refurbished iphone in my future unless of course apple decides to share facetime and itunes with other platforms like microsoft shares office skype wunderlist and many other apps with it competitors btw m what would be considered an elderly woman and not some it professional 
6638,Apple iPhone 4s,0,phone would not hold charge so had to purchase solid battery from reputable seller

6781,Apple iPhone 4s,0,product was not unlocked so we couldn use it and had to return it very disappointed
6782,Apple iPhone 4s,1,i was conscious of buying iphone online due too so many people getting ripped off by broken iphone sent to them or stolen one that can be activated even best advice can give read the sellers reviews and positive reviews number anywhere between 90 to 98 you should be fine have been wanting iphone for awhile but don have 600 to shell out for one about this iphone it is 4s it has sim card slot side it was unlocked phone which it maybe but said cell phone carrier verizon so my best guess it is unlocked and previous owner used them either way it worked just fine with straight talk could text and send photos have sim card slot but did not have to use it they ask me for some numbers and it worked the video is ok would say lot better then old cellphone 1080 30p good for taking pics with family friends video or good stand by but by no means should this be used for professional filmography the buttons are on the left two volume buttons up and down and button to set the phone to ring on be silent theres home buttom that is round wit square graphic the to button right issleep shut down towards the left is head phone jack and what seems to be mic wifi works the apps store is great you can download free magic app or google voice to make free wifi calls wifi does work it runs ios 9 3 the newest one memory 16gb you may want to little more on 32 gb icloud gives you 5gb free which is not lot

6877,Apple iPhone 4s,1,after losing my htc one in the sea needed quick replacement and chose the iphone 4s not the latest and greatest but it still good phone with great user interface it does everything need it to do and the speaker is to my ear better than the speakers in the drowned phone ll probably keep it longer than d planed because it has one thing going for it it fits my pocket unlike the htc which is why it at the bottom of the sea ordered this from the used selection to get prime 1 day shipping it arrived in sealed pristine oem packaging and all accessories were likewise sealed in oem packets for some reason m not supposed to mention the warehouse deal got but it was better deal than d hoped for 
6878,Apple iPhone 4s,1,arrived early and in great condition new like the description said love it 
6879,Apple iPhone 4s,0,battery life on my phone is screwed up

6884,Apple iPhone 4s,1,what was looking for was phone with few scratches and or scuffs what received was brand new iphone 4s no scratches no scuffs everything in working order thank you 
6885,Apple iPhone 4s,0,battery not good
6886,Apple iPhone 4s,1,i love just like my other one until it was destroyed 
6887,Apple iPhone 4s,1,i am very satisfied 
6888,Apple iPhone 4s,1,i love it and also my son does 
6889,Apple iPhone 4s,1,i love my phone it is like new and received it in such timely manner 
6890,Apple iPhone 4s,1,this phone was exactly what wanted and it worked well dropped it and shattered the face shortly after owning it but was able to pick up an iphone 5 
6891,Apple iPhone 4s,1,absolute amazing transaction got the phone with not single scratch on it in fact it looked brand new to me thanks for the phone and thanks so much for the smooth transaction 
6892,Apple iPhone 4s,1,i am very pleased with the 4s it is brand new lost my 4s and getting replacement was great until m ready for upgrade 
6893,Apple iPhone 4s,0,i have tried to contact this vendor twice through amazon to get more information on this like new phone wanted to know little more on actual condition and if any accessories are included this is new vendor so am cautious as they have no track record but am serious potential customer this lack of communication does not instill confidence in this supplier have purchased one phone already from another vendor who provided sound information and great service the item was exactly what was described on the amazon site 
6894,Apple iPhone 4s,0,i was really excited to get this new iphone since was looking to replace my 16gb with 32gb however when it arrived 1 it was poorly packaged the box was not sealed on the edges which could have easily been open and stolen 2 sadly the lcd digitizer was defective had to return it this particular iphone must have been from badge of defective lcd digitizer 
6895,Apple iPhone 4s,0,fair price for the 32gb phone 4s battery does not last long but that may be normal wear and tare but expected little more in that sense 
6896,Apple iPhone 4s,1,enjoying new purchase would have been perfect if insurance was offered but the price was right for the product purchased 
6897,Apple iPhone 4s,1,this has been my favorite cell phone ever know you can get bigger screen with the 5s but you can beat the price on this one 
6898,Apple iPhone 4s,0,i purchased this item for its specifications but also for the description of the condition since it was used the description said it was in excellent condition the up volume works great but the down volume does not work at all considered returning it for refund but rarely use the volume switch and otherwise it good in the end it just wasn worth it but do believe that the seller knew this and hid the fact in short the description was not truthful gary kirsheman
6899,Apple iPhone 4s,1,very good product and fine service would recommend to friend easy switch from my old unit to this one 
6900,Apple iPhone 4s,1,nice phone the charger is not so good though it broken few weeks after get it 
6901,Apple iPhone 4s,1,works great made it on time
6902,Apple iPhone 4s,1,great
6903,Apple iPhone 4s,1,perfect phone for regular smart phone user 
6904,Apple iPhone 4s,1,very good
6905,Apple iPhone 4s,0,for the first month it operated like new and then the product became defective sent it to apple to get it fixed and they could not do anything for it it is complete and utter waste of my 399 am highly upset but there is nothing can do about it 
6906,Apple iPhone 4s,1,late response this seller offered me fantastic deal on great device the benefit to my review is 2 years later and its still an awesome value m using it to write the review the device arrived as said in better condition then was listed great listed as good and everything works as well as lasted throughly satisfied thank you 
6907,Apple iPhone 4s,1,excellent condition just as describe
6908,Apple iPhone 4s,0,starting with the packaging the serial number did not match on the box and the phone immediately knew something was fishy still decided to give it shot but soon realized that battery did not last more than day all other features were working well contacted amazon about the product and was able to get the return still lot of hassel to go through would recommend spending few bucks extra and buying from wireless store for the peace of mind 
6909,Apple iPhone 4s,1,my previous iphone 4s got washed along with my jeans tried all the recovery tricks but my phone was very clean but very dead didn want to use my upgrade to buy new phone ll wait until the iphone 6 later this year so decided my best approach was to buy used 4s and hang onto it until could upgrade this unit arrived promptly had the latest ios installed meaning no jailbreak was spotless and without blemish recovered the phone from my itunes backup and within 45 minutes was in business still have my clean dead phone thinking about using it as an anchor for model boat

6914,Apple iPhone 4s,0,i very sorry to say that despite the fact had very positive opinion abou blink the seller so far am unable to feel the same way anymore bought the phone in march as refurbished and till now it worked perfectly all until few days ago when began experiencing some serious issues with it starting with spots onh the screen then it wouldn turn on after turning off then the camera wouldn work properly even though took really good care of it when contactedt them for replace they told me that they are really sorry but they are unable to assist me with my issue because the legal 90 day period of time for replacements has passed it not my fault that the product broke paid resonable amount of money for it and now am stuck with it defective am really disappointed with the whole experience

6925,Apple iPhone 4s,0,i bought iphone 4s like new at for 370 but when got the item it only iphone 4 and there lots of scracth in the back and side metal it not worth for the price

6927,Apple iPhone 4s,1,i did something stupid with my iphone and needed to order another one got one from amazon used selection figuring that few scratches would just be minor issue what received was unit that looked like new after updating the software everything worked like champ and just like the one destroyed this one is lot more useful than ever thought it would be from the mail application to the flashlight from maps to the phone it just handy little device and unlike the android devices at least the ones ve seen lot more intuitive which is great for me since don like to read manuals 
6928,Apple iPhone 4s,1,i want to say it is nearly perfect burnish use is very good hope it can help other want to buy

6932,Apple iPhone 4s,0,i haven placed my sim card in the phone yet but think you sold me iphone 4 instead of an iphone 4s looked at the serial number on the back and looked it up and it matches the iphone 4 and also the box didn have the beside the name which also leads me to think that you sent me the wrong thing but get my sim card on tuesday so if set up the phone and it has siri there won be problem

6955,Apple iPhone 4s,0,i ordered iphone 4s at for christmas to give to my 15 year old son the phone was delivered at the expected time and that is one reason why am giving rating of two stars realized that the phone was used so was really nervous when opened the package the phone was in excellent condition no scratches or cracked screens so that is the other reason why rated it two stars from this point it receives no stars turned on the phone and went to settings it said verizon carrier the description clearly stated at my order form stated at my plans to add this phone to my plan was ruined had to put the phone on verizon plan which was totally out of the way gave the phone to my son on christmas he was excited to have it when my family members asked what phone he had said iphone 4s my son corrected me by saying iphone 4 mama the description clearly stated 4s my order form stated 4s and paid for 4s was so upset did not bother to try to correct the situation should have known better to order something used from amazon please be cautious when ordering used items from amazon
